You are a Frappe Framework expert.,Where can I learn more about creating DocTypes?,You can find detailed information about creating DocTypes in the Frappe Framework documentation at [https://frappeframework.com/docs/v14/user/en/tutorial/create-a-doctype](https://frappeframework.com/docs/v14/user/en/tutorial/create-a-doctype). The documentation provides comprehensive tutorials and guides on building custom applications using DocTypes.
You are a Frappe Framework expert.,What is a DocType?,A DocType is analogous to a Model in other frameworks. It defines properties of a data structure and its behavior. You can think of it as a blueprint for creating data records in your application.
You are a Frappe Framework expert.,Why do I need to enable developer mode before creating a DocType?,"Enabling developer mode provides you with the necessary tools and features to create and manage custom DocTypes. It enables boilerplate code generation, allowing you to easily track your custom DocTypes under version control with your application."
You are a Frappe Framework expert.,How can I create a new DocType?,"You can create a new DocType from the DocType List within the Frappe Desk. You can access the DocType List through the Awesomebar.  To create a new DocType, click on 'New,' enter a name for your DocType (e.g., 'Article'), select a Module (e.g., 'Library Management'), and then define the fields for your DocType."
You are a Frappe Framework expert.,"What happens when I create a new DocType, like the 'Article' DocType?","Creating a DocType like 'Article' leads to the creation of several components: 

1. **Database Table:**  A database table named `tabArticle` is automatically generated, incorporating the fields you defined. 
2. **Desk Views:**  Frappe creates a List view for displaying records and a Form view for editing or creating new records.
3. **Form Layout:** The form layout mirrors the order of fields you specified, making it easy to manage the form's appearance. 
4. **Boilerplate Code:** Several Python and Javascript files are created to support your DocType: `article.json` defines DocType attributes, `article.js` handles client-side form interactions, `article.py` controls server-side logic, and `test_article.py` provides a boilerplate for writing unit tests.  These files are generated under your app's directory."
You are a Frappe Framework expert.,What are some important considerations when creating a new DocType?,"When creating a DocType, it's essential to keep in mind:

* **Custom? Checkbox:** Uncheck the 'Custom?' checkbox if you want the default boilerplate code to be generated for your DocType. If you check it, you'll have more control over the code but you'll need to write more of it manually. 
* **Field Types:**  Choose appropriate field types (Data, Select, Text Editor, etc.) for your fields to ensure they function as intended. 
* **Naming Conventions:**  Fields defined in Title Case will be automatically converted to snake case (e.g., 'Article Name' becomes 'article_name') when used as column names in the database table."
You are a Frappe Framework expert.,What are DocTypes in Frappe Framework?,DocTypes are the fundamental building blocks of applications within the Frappe Framework. They essentially define the structure and behavior of data within your application. Think of them as blueprints for creating custom objects or entities that represent your business data.
You are a Frappe Framework expert.,I see that we can customize the naming of a DocType. How does that work?,"You're right! By default, when you create a document with a DocType, it gets assigned a randomly generated hash as its `name`. But you can customize this. You can set the `name` of the document to be based on a field in your DocType.  For example, in the 'Article' DocType, we can use the 'Article Name' field to automatically assign a name to the document. You can do this by configuring the 'Auto Name' field in the DocType's settings, using the format `field:article_name`."
You are a Frappe Framework expert.,Can you explain the importance of DocType naming in Frappe?,"DocType naming is crucial in Frappe for a few key reasons:

* **Uniqueness:**  By setting a field-based name, you ensure that each document you create has a unique identifier, preventing duplicate entries and ensuring data integrity.

* **Meaningful Identifiers:**  Using a field like 'Article Name' makes it easy to recognize and understand the contents of each document. This is especially helpful when managing large amounts of data.

* **Data Retrieval:**  Well-defined names can make searching and retrieving data much more efficient, as you can directly query based on these meaningful identifiers.

You can learn more about DocType Naming in detail by visiting [https://frappeframework.com/docs/v14/user/en/basics/doctypes/naming](https://frappeframework.com/docs/v14/user/en/basics/doctypes/naming)."
You are a Frappe Framework expert.,I'm also interested in customizing the layout of the DocType form. How can I do that?,You can easily customize the layout of your DocType forms in Frappe to enhance usability and make them visually appealing.  You can use special fields like 'Column Break' and 'Section Break' to organize fields into distinct sections and columns.  This helps you arrange your fields logically and make the form more user-friendly. You can also hide fields that are not essential for the form by toggling the 'Hidden' property of the field.
You are a Frappe Framework expert.,Is there a way to display an image directly in the form itself?,"Yes, absolutely! You can use the 'Form Settings' section of your DocType to configure how an image field is displayed.  By entering the name of your image field (e.g., 'image') in the 'Image Field' setting, the image will appear prominently at the top left of the form. This is a great way to visually enhance your forms."
You are a Frappe Framework expert.,How can I control who has access to what data and actions within a DocType?,"Frappe offers powerful permission management features that allow you to granularly control access to DocTypes and their associated data. You can define roles and assign permissions to those roles, specifying which actions (read, write, create, delete, etc.) are permitted for each role within a given DocType.  For example, you might create a 'Librarian' role with full access, while a 'Library Member' role would have only read permissions. This ensures data security and helps you manage who can perform specific actions within your application."
You are a Frappe Framework expert.,Can you explain what controller methods are in Frappe?,"Controller methods in Frappe allow you to write custom business logic that gets executed during specific stages of a document's lifecycle.  Think of them as hooks that trigger your code at certain points, like before saving a document or after it's been created."
You are a Frappe Framework expert.,I'm working on creating a 'Library Member' doctype. How can I use a controller method to automatically generate the full name field from the first and last name?,"You can achieve that by using the `before_save` method within your `library_member.py` file. Inside this method, you'll write logic to combine the first and last names and assign the result to the `full_name` field. This method will automatically run every time a Library Member document is saved."
You are a Frappe Framework expert.,"Okay, so I should create a `before_save` method inside the `LibraryMember` class in my `library_member.py` file. Can you give me an example of how to write the code for this method?","```python
class LibraryMember(Document):
    # This method will run every time a document is saved
    def before_save(self):
        self.full_name = f'{self.first_name} {self.last_name or }' 
```

In this code, `self.full_name` is assigned the combined first and last names. The `self.last_name or ` part ensures that if the last name is empty, it won't add an extra space to the full name."
You are a Frappe Framework expert.,"Great!  I've implemented the `before_save` method, but the full name field still isn't showing up when I create a new library member. What could be the problem?","It's possible that server-side scripts are not enabled. You can check and enable them by running the following command in your terminal, replacing `<YOUR_SITE>` with your actual site name:  

`bench --site <YOUR_SITE> set-config server_script_enabled true`

After that, restart your Frappe server.  This should allow the `before_save` method to execute correctly."
You are a Frappe Framework expert.,"I've enabled server-side scripts, but the full name is still not appearing. Any other things I should check?","It's possible that the cache is causing issues. Try clearing the cache by going to **Settings > Reload** in your Frappe instance. After clearing the cache, try creating a new Library Member again. The full name should now appear after you save the document."
You are a Frappe Framework expert.,Where can I find more information about other controller methods besides `before_save`?,You can learn about all the available controller methods and their uses in the Frappe documentation at [Controller](https://frappeframework.com/docs/v14/user/en/basics/doctypes/controllers) docs.
You are a Frappe framework expert.,What is a DocType in the Frappe framework?,"A DocType is the fundamental building block of any application within the Frappe Framework. It essentially defines the structure of your data, like a table in a relational database. Each DocType represents a different type of information you want to store and manage within your application. For example, you might have DocTypes for 'Customers,' 'Products,' 'Invoices,' or 'Employees,' depending on the application you're building."
You are a Frappe framework expert.,Can you explain the concept of Linked DocTypes?,"Linked DocTypes are essentially foreign keys in other frameworks. They allow you to establish relationships between different types of data within your application.  A Link field in a DocType lets you link a record to another DocType. For example, in our 'Library Membership' DocType, the 'Library Member' field is a Link field that links to the 'Library Member' DocType. This means you can associate a specific library membership with a particular library member, creating a clear connection between those records.  You can link any DocType to any other DocType, enabling you to build complex relationships and connections within your application."
You are a Frappe framework expert.,What are Submittable DocTypes and what states can they have?,"A Submittable DocType is a type of DocType that allows you to control the state of a document. When you enable 'Is Submittable,' you can track the progress of a document through different stages. These stages include:

* **Draft:** The initial state, where the document is still under development and can be freely edited.
* **Submitted:**  A document in this state indicates it has been reviewed and finalized. Changes to the document are restricted once it reaches this state.
* **Cancelled:**  This state marks the document as invalid. The document can only be amended by creating a duplicate and linking it to the original cancelled document using the 'Amended From' field."
You are a Frappe framework expert.,I see the `before_submit` method in the `library_membership.py` code. What does this method do?,"The `before_submit` method is a built-in function in the Frappe Framework that allows you to execute custom logic before a document is submitted.  In the `library_membership.py` code, the `before_submit` method is used to prevent creating overlapping Library Memberships.  It checks if there's already an active membership for the selected Library Member. If an active membership exists, it throws an error message, preventing the user from creating the new membership."
You are a Frappe framework expert.,Can you explain the difference between Master and Transactional DocTypes?,"Master DocTypes represent entities that are typically unchanging or change relatively infrequently.  Think of them as the core data that your application revolves around. Examples include:

* **Article:**  Information about a specific article in the library (title, author, etc.)
* **Library Member:**  Details about a library member (name, contact information, etc.)

Transactional DocTypes, on the other hand, capture events or transactions that occur within your system.  They track how your master data interacts or changes over time. An example is:

* **Library Membership:**  Records the details of a member's membership (start date, end date, paid status)."
You are a Frappe framework expert.,"What are Single DocTypes, and how do they differ from other DocTypes?","Single DocTypes are similar to singleton records in other frameworks. They are used to store global settings or configurations that should only have one instance.  When you enable 'Is Single' for a DocType, it doesn't create a separate database table. Instead, its data is stored in the `tabSingles` table.  This makes it efficient for storing global settings like 'Loan Period' and 'Maximum Number of Issued Articles' in our library example."
You are a Frappe Framework expert.,Can you explain what Form Scripts are and how they work in Frappe?,"Form Scripts are client-side JavaScript code that enhances the user experience of your forms in Frappe. They are written using the Frappe UI framework and run within the browser. These scripts allow you to customize the behavior of your forms by adding new features, modifying existing functionality, and automating tasks. You can write Form Scripts to manipulate data, add custom buttons, change the appearance of forms, and much more. The example given in the documentation shows how to add custom buttons to the ""Library Member"" form, which allow you to easily create related ""Library Membership"" and ""Library Transaction"" documents."
You are a Frappe Framework expert.,I'm interested in learning more about Form Scripts. Where can I find documentation and resources?,"You can find the complete Form Scripts documentation at the following link: [Form Scripts API](https://frappeframework.com/docs/v14/user/en/api/form). This page covers the API and functionalities of Form Scripts in detail, allowing you to explore and implement advanced customizations for your Frappe applications."
You are a Frappe Framework expert.,Could you provide some practical examples of how Form Scripts can be used to improve the user experience?,"Sure. Here are some practical examples of how Form Scripts can enhance user experience:

1. **Data Validation:** Form Scripts can be used to validate user input and ensure data integrity. For example, you could write a script to check if a field is required, if a field contains valid data format (like email or phone number), or if a field has a specific range of values.

2. **Dynamic Fields:** You can use Form Scripts to dynamically add or remove fields based on user selections or other conditions. This can be helpful in creating forms that are more user-friendly and adaptable to different scenarios.

3. **Custom Actions:** Form Scripts allow you to add custom buttons and actions to your forms. You can use this to create shortcuts, automate tasks, or trigger specific workflows. For example, you can add a button to a sales order form to automatically create an invoice after the order is placed.

4. **Real-time Updates:** Form Scripts can be used to update the form in real-time based on user interactions or changes in data. For example, you can use a script to automatically calculate the total amount of a sales order based on the quantity and price of the items being ordered."
You are a Frappe Framework expert.,I want to learn how to create a custom button on a form. How do I do that using Form Scripts?,"Here's how you can create a custom button on a form using Form Scripts in Frappe. Let's take the example of adding a ""Create Membership"" button to the ""Library Member"" form as shown in the documentation:

1. **Create the JavaScript File:**  Create a new JavaScript file named **library_member.js** in your Frappe application's custom scripts directory. This file will contain the code for your Form Script.

2. **Write the Form Script Code:** Inside the JavaScript file, write the following code:

```javascript
frappe.ui.form.on('Library Member', {
  refresh: function(frm) {
    frm.add_custom_button('Create Membership', () => {
      frappe.new_doc('Library Membership', {
        library_member: frm.doc.name
      })
    })
  }
});
```

3. **Explanation:**

* `frappe.ui.form.on('Library Member', ...)`: This line specifies that the Form Script will run on the ""Library Member"" DocType.
* `refresh: function(frm)`: This defines a function that will be executed whenever the form is refreshed or loaded.
* `frm.add_custom_button('Create Membership', ...)`: This adds a custom button labeled ""Create Membership"" to the form.
* `frappe.new_doc('Library Membership', ...)`: This function creates a new document of the ""Library Membership"" DocType and automatically sets the `library_member` field to the name of the current ""Library Member"" record.

4. **Test the Button:** After saving the JavaScript file, refresh your browser. You should now see the ""Create Membership"" button on the ""Library Member"" form. Clicking this button will create a new ""Library Membership"" document with the correct member already selected."
You are a Frappe Framework expert.,How do I make sure the custom button I created is only visible to specific users or user roles?,"You can control the visibility of custom buttons based on user roles or permissions using the `frappe.user.has_role` function. Here's how you can modify the Form Script to make the ""Create Membership"" button visible only to users with the ""Librarian"" role:

```javascript
frappe.ui.form.on('Library Member', {
  refresh: function(frm) {
    if (frappe.user.has_role('Librarian')) {
      frm.add_custom_button('Create Membership', () => {
        frappe.new_doc('Library Membership', {
          library_member: frm.doc.name
        })
      })
    }
  }
});
```

By adding the `if (frappe.user.has_role('Librarian'))` condition, the custom button will only be added to the form if the currently logged-in user has the ""Librarian"" role. You can adapt this logic to any role or permission you need to enforce."
You are a Frappe Framework expert.,I'm curious about the `frappe.new_doc()` function used in the example. What does it do and how can I use it in my own Form Scripts?,"The `frappe.new_doc()` function is a powerful tool in Frappe for creating new documents. It takes the DocType name as the first argument and an optional object of initial values as the second argument. In our example, `frappe.new_doc('Library Membership', {library_member: frm.doc.name})` creates a new ""Library Membership"" document and sets the `library_member` field to the name of the current ""Library Member"" record. This way, you can streamline the process of creating related documents from within another document's form. You can utilize this function in your own Form Scripts to automate the creation of new documents based on various actions or user interactions, making your applications more efficient and user-friendly."

Each worker has a specific timeout: 'worker_short' has a 300-second timeout, 'worker_long' has a 1500-second timeout, and 'worker_default' has a 300-second timeout. You can assign jobs to different workers based on their time requirements. Long-running jobs can be assigned to 'worker_long', while shorter tasks can be processed by 'worker_short' or 'worker_default'."
You are a Frappe Framework expert.,What are Frappe apps?,Frappe apps are Python packages that leverage the Frappe Framework.  They reside in the `apps` directory within your `frappe-bench` directory. Think of them as self-contained modules that extend the functionality of the Frappe platform.
You are a Frappe Framework expert.,What's the purpose of the `frappe` app?,"The `frappe` app is the heart of the Frappe Framework. It acts as the foundation for all other Frappe apps, providing the core functionalities and features that make the platform work."
You are a Frappe Framework expert.,How do I create a new Frappe app?,"You can create a new Frappe app using the `bench new-app` command from your `frappe-bench` directory. This command sets up a boilerplate structure for your app. You'll be prompted to provide details like the app title, description, publisher, email, icon, color, and license. After creating the app, it will be automatically added to `apps.txt`."
You are a Frappe Framework expert.,Can you explain the purpose of the `requirements.txt` file in a Frappe app?,"The `requirements.txt` file lists all the Python dependencies needed for your Frappe app to run correctly. When you install the app, these dependencies are also installed, ensuring that your app has everything it needs to function properly."
You are a Frappe Framework expert.,What's the difference between `requirements.txt` and `dev-requirements.txt`?,"Both files list Python dependencies.  `requirements.txt` holds the dependencies required for your app's core functionality, while `dev-requirements.txt` is for development-specific tools and libraries.  `dev-requirements.txt` is optional, and its dependencies are only installed if you're in developer mode."
You are a Frappe Framework expert.,What does the `custom_app/hooks.py` file do?,"The `hooks.py` file lets you extend or modify the standard behavior of the Frappe Framework. It allows you to hook into various events within the framework, such as document creation, updates, or deletions, and customize the app's actions accordingly."
You are a Frappe Framework expert.,I'm confused about how Frappe apps are organized into modules. Could you explain the `modules.txt` file?,"Every Frappe app is divided into modules.  Each DocType, a data model representing an entity in your app, belongs to a specific module. The `modules.txt` file lists all the modules within your app, providing a clear structure for organizing your app's components."
You are a Frappe Framework expert.,What's the purpose of the `public` folder in a Frappe app?,"The `public` folder is where you store static assets like CSS, JavaScript, and images. These assets are served directly to the client-side and can be accessed via the URL `/assets/custom_app/**/*`. For example, an image file `public/img/logo.png` can be accessed through `/assets/custom_app/img/logo.png`."
You are a Frappe Framework expert.,Can you explain how to use the `templates` folder for Jinja templates?,"The `templates` folder is used for managing Jinja templates within your app. You can organize your templates as needed.  When you include a Jinja template, such as `{% include ""templates/navbar/navbar.html"" %}`, the framework will first search this folder and then fallback to other apps if the template isn't found."
You are a Frappe Framework expert.,What are 'portal pages' and how do they relate to the `www` folder?,"Portal pages are web pages accessible through your Frappe site. The `www` folder in your app maps directly to these portal pages. The directory structure within `www` defines the URLs for your portal pages.  For example, a file named `www/about.html` would be accessible through the URL `/about`. You can learn more about portal pages on the Frappe Framework documentation site: [https://frappeframework.com/docs/user/en/portal-pages](https://frappeframework.com/docs/user/en/portal-pages)."
You are a Frappe Framework expert.,What steps do I need to take to make my app available for use?,"To use your Frappe app, you need to install it on a site. Installing an app creates the models within the site database, essentially setting up the database tables needed for the app's functionality. To install an app on a site, you can run the following command from your `frappe-bench` directory, replacing `site_name` and `custom_app` with the actual names:

```bash
$ bench --site site_name install-app custom_app
```

You can then check if the installation was successful using:

```bash
$ bench --site site_name list-apps
```

This command should list your `frappe` app and the newly installed `custom_app`. "
You are a Frappe Framework expert.,What are sites in Frappe?,"In Frappe, a site represents a tenant or a separate instance of your application. Each site has its own database, making it a multi-tenant platform. Think of it like having individual websites under a single Frappe framework."
You are a Frappe Framework expert.,Where are these sites stored?,Sites are stored in a directory called `sites` within your Frappe `bench` directory. This directory typically resides in `frappe-bench/sites`. It's the central location for all your Frappe sites.
You are a Frappe Framework expert.,How do I create a new site?,"To create a new site, you use the `bench new-site` command from within your `frappe-bench` directory. For example, to create a site named `mysite.local`, you would run: `$ bench new-site mysite.local`. This will create a new directory for your site within the `sites` directory."
You are a Frappe Framework expert.,What is the `apps.txt` file in the sites directory?,"The `apps.txt` file lists all the Frappe apps that are available to be installed on a particular site. This file is automatically updated when you use the `bench get-app` or `bench new-app` commands. Essentially, it acts as a manifest for the apps you want to use with your site."
You are a Frappe Framework expert.,Can I configure settings specific to a site?,"Yes, you can! Each site has a `site_config.json` file located within its directory. This file lets you store site-specific configurations, such as database credentials, administrator passwords, and more. You can learn more about managing site configurations in the [comprehensive documentation](https://frappeframework.com/docs/v14/user/en/basics/site_config)."
You are a Frappe Framework expert.,How does Frappe determine which site to use for a request?,"Frappe uses the `Host` header in the HTTP request to match a site. If the host matches a site, that site is automatically selected. Alternatively, you can use the `X-Frappe-Site-Name` header in the request to explicitly specify the desired site. You can also manually tell the development server to use a particular site using the `bench --site mysite.local serve` command."
You are a Frappe Framework expert.,Can I make a site the default one?,"Absolutely. To set a site as the default, use the `bench use mysite.local` command. After running this command, you can execute site-specific commands without needing the `--site` parameter. For example, instead of `bench --site mysite.local migrate`, you can simply run `bench migrate`."
You are a Frappe Framework expert.,What is a DocType in the Frappe Framework?,"A DocType is the fundamental building block for any application built using the Frappe Framework. It essentially defines the structure of your data, encompassing both the model (how the data is stored) and the view (how the data is presented and interacted with).  Imagine it as a blueprint for a specific type of data within your application."
You are a Frappe Framework expert.,Can you explain the relationship between a DocType and a database table?,"When you create a DocType, Frappe Framework automatically creates a corresponding database table to store the data associated with that DocType. The table name is prefixed with `tab` followed by the DocType name (e.g., a DocType named `Article` would have a table named `tabArticle`). This seamless integration makes it easier to manage and manipulate your data without needing to write explicit SQL queries."
You are a Frappe Framework expert.,What are some of the standard conventions followed in the Frappe Framework for DocTypes?,"The Frappe Framework encourages consistent naming practices to streamline development. Here are some key conventions:

1. **Singular DocType Names:** If you're storing a list of articles, your DocType should be named 'Article' (singular). 
2. **Table Name Prefix:**  Database table names are always prefixed with `tab`, so the table for the `Article` DocType would be `tabArticle`."
You are a Frappe Framework expert.,How can I create a new DocType in Frappe?,"The simplest way to create a new DocType is by typing `new doctype` in the search bar within the Frappe Desk. This will bring up a form where you can define the fields, properties, and behavior of your new DocType."
You are a Frappe Framework expert.,I'm intrigued by the concept of 'Meta' in DocTypes. Can you elaborate?,"The 'Meta' in DocTypes refers to the additional information that goes beyond just the data fields themselves. It defines how the data behaves within the system, including things like permissions, validation rules, workflows, and more.  This 'Meta' data is also stored in a database table, making it easy to modify and customize DocTypes without needing extensive coding."
You are a Frappe Framework expert.,What are some of the key benefits of using DocTypes in the Frappe Framework?,"DocTypes are designed to simplify application development within the Frappe Framework. Here are some of the key advantages:

* **Simplified Data Management:** DocTypes provide a structured way to manage your data, making it easier to organize, retrieve, and manipulate information. 
* **Out-of-the-box Features:** Frappe provides various built-in features, such as list views, form views, and actions, that are automatically associated with each DocType, saving you time and effort. 
* **Rapid Customization:** The ability to change DocType 'Meta' data on the fly allows for quick and easy customization, enabling you to adapt your applications to evolving needs without extensive coding."
You are a Frappe Framework expert.,Can you explain the user authentication system in Frappe?,"Frappe has a built-in user authentication system that manages user accounts, roles, permissions, and cookie-based user sessions. It offers various features like user creation, role assignment, Doctype permissions, and more, ensuring secure access and control over your applications."
You are a Frappe Framework expert.,What's the difference between a User and a Role in Frappe?,"A User represents an authenticated individual who can access the system. A Role defines the actions a User can perform on specific DocTypes.  For instance, a 'Blogger' role might have read, write, and create permissions on the 'Blog Post' DocType but only read access to 'Blog Category'."
You are a Frappe Framework expert.,How can I customize permissions for a DocType?,"You can configure DocType permissions within the DocType's 'Permissions' table.  You can assign specific roles to a DocType and define what actions (read, write, create, delete, etc.) those roles have on the DocType's data."
You are a Frappe Framework expert.,"What are Permission Levels, and how are they useful?","Permission Levels allow you to group fields within a DocType and apply different roles to each level. This helps in granular control over data access. For example, you could have a 'Basic' level with read-only access for general users and an 'Advanced' level with write access for specific teams."
You are a Frappe Framework expert.,I need to manage roles and permissions for my application. Where can I find the Role Permissions Manager?,The Role Permissions Manager is a user-friendly tool that allows you to manage role permissions. It provides a clear interface to view and override the default permissions assigned to roles. You can access it from the Frappe web interface.
You are a Frappe Framework expert.,"What are User Permissions, and how do they differ from Roles?","User Permissions provide an additional layer of control on top of Roles. They allow you to define specific restrictions on a user-by-user basis. For instance, you can create a User Permission to ensure that a user can only view 'Blog Posts' they created, regardless of the role they have."
You are a Frappe Framework expert.,Can I control which modules and DocTypes are visible to specific users?,"Yes, you can configure which modules and DocTypes are visible to users through the 'Allow Modules' section within the User form. You can also hide a DocType from a user by removing read permissions for the relevant role from the Role Permissions Manager."
You are a Frappe Framework expert.,How does Frappe handle password security?,"Frappe encrypts passwords using password hashing and stores them securely in a separate database table called `__Auth`.  Additionally, you can configure password strength requirements and login attempt throttling to further enhance security."
You are a Frappe Framework expert.,I'm interested in enabling third-party authentication like Google or Facebook login. Can Frappe do that?,"Yes, Frappe supports third-party authentication using OAuth.  To set this up, you need to configure a 'Social Login Key' which involves creating an application within the third-party provider's developer console and obtaining the necessary credentials. You can find more information on setting up Social Login Keys in the Frappe documentation: [https://frappeframework.com/docs/user/en/guides/integration/social_login_key](https://frappeframework.com/docs/user/en/guides/integration/social_login_key)."
You are a Frappe Framework expert.,What are asset bundles in Frappe?,"Asset bundles in Frappe are essentially collections of static files like JavaScript, CSS, and other related resources that are compiled and optimized before being served to the browser. This process is designed to improve performance and streamline web application development."
You are a Frappe Framework expert.,What types of files can be bundled in Frappe?,"Frappe's asset bundler supports a wide range of file types, including:

* `.js` (JavaScript with modern syntax using `import` and `export`)
* `.ts` (TypeScript files)
* `.vue` (Vue single file components)
* `.css` (CSS processed using PostCSS)
* `.scss` (SASS files)
* `.sass` (SASS files with indentation syntax)
* `.styl` (Stylus files)
* `.less` (Less files)"
You are a Frappe Framework expert.,How do I build these asset bundles?,"You can build asset bundles using the `bench build` command from your `frappe-bench` directory. For instance, to build all assets, you would run:

```bash
$ bench build
```

You can also specify which apps you want to build by using the `--apps` option. For example, to only build the `frappe` and `erpnext` assets:

```bash
$ bench build --apps frappe,erpnext
```"
You are a Frappe Framework expert.,What about live reloading? How does that work?,"Frappe's asset bundler comes with a watch mode (`bench watch`) that automatically rebuilds assets whenever you make changes to your source files. This allows for seamless development as your browser will automatically refresh with the latest changes. Starting with Frappe version 14, the Desk interface will automatically reload when assets are rebuilt in watch mode. You can control this behavior through the `LIVE_RELOAD` environment variable or by modifying the `live_reload` setting in your `common_site_config.json` file."
You are a Frappe Framework expert.,How are bundle files named and where are they placed?,"Bundle files are typically named with the `.bundle` extension (e.g., `main.bundle.js`, `style.bundle.scss`) and placed within the `public` folder of your Frappe app. The bundler will then compile them into the `dist` directory within the `assets` folder. The output file names will include a unique hash for cache-busting purposes (e.g., `/assets/[app]/dist/js/main.bundle.[hash].js`). The extension will be adjusted based on the file type, for example, a `.scss` file will be compiled to a `.css` file."
You are a Frappe Framework expert.,How do I include bundled assets in my HTML files?,"Frappe provides a couple of helpful Jinja methods for including bundled assets in your HTML files:

* **`include_script` and `include_style`:** These methods output the correct path of the bundled file, including the appropriate HTML markup for `.js` and `.css` files respectively. You can use them within your custom HTML files.

* **`app_include_js` and `app_include_css`:** For assets you want to include in the main application (`/app`), you can add these settings to your app's `hooks.py` file.

* **`bundled_asset`:** This method returns the path to the bundled asset, which you can use if you only need the path and not the full HTML markup."
You are a Frappe Framework expert.,Can I use libraries from npm in my Frappe app?,"Yes, you can easily use npm libraries in your Frappe apps. Install the library using `yarn` within your app's directory. For instance, to install the `dayjs` library:

```bash
$ cd frappe-bench/apps/myapp
$ yarn add dayjs
```

Then you can import it into your source files like so:

```javascript
// myapp/public/main.bundle.js
import * as dayjs from 'dayjs';

console.log(dayjs())
```"
You are a Frappe Framework expert.,What is the advantage of using `frappe.require`?,"`frappe.require` allows you to lazy load bundled assets within the Frappe Admin UI (`/app`). This means you can load specific scripts or styles only when they are needed, improving initial page load performance. It's particularly useful for loading assets based on certain conditions."
You are a Frappe Framework expert.,How can I build my assets for production?,"To build your assets in production mode, use the `--production` flag with the `bench build` command. This will minify your bundled files, resulting in smaller file sizes and improved performance for your production environment. For example:

```bash
$ bench build --production
```"
You are a Frappe Framework expert.,Where are static assets served from in Frappe Framework?,Static assets in Frappe Framework are served from the `frappe-bench/sites/assets` folder. This folder is directly served by nginx during production deployment.
You are a Frappe Framework expert.,How do I access a static file located at `frappe-bench/sites/assets/hero.png`?,You can access it publicly via the URL `/assets/hero.png`.
You are a Frappe Framework expert.,What is the purpose of the `public` folder in each Frappe app?,"The `public` folder is used to serve static assets for the specific app. It's symlinked to the `frappe-bench/sites/assets/[appname]` folder, making its contents accessible publicly through the `/assets/[appname]` path."
You are a Frappe Framework expert.,Can you explain how bundled assets are served in Frappe?,"Bundled assets in Frappe, which are generated during the build process, are located in the `assets/[appname]/dist/js` and `assets/[appname]/dist/css` folders. These assets are accessible via URLs like `/assets/[appname]/dist/js/main.bundle.[hash].js`."
You are a Frappe Framework expert.,How can I access a user-uploaded file stored at `frappe-bench/sites/[sitename]/public/files/profile.png`?,You can access it publicly via the URL `/files/profile.png`.
You are a Frappe Framework expert.,I have a private file located at `frappe-bench/sites/[sitename]/private/files/profile.png`. How can I access it?,"You can access it through the URL `/private/files/profile.png`, but access is restricted to authorized users."
You are a Frappe Framework expert.,"Where are site backups stored in Frappe, and how can I access them?","Site backups are stored in the `frappe-bench/sites/[sitename]/private/backups` folder. You can access them via URLs like `/backups/20210502_182223-[sitename]-database.sql.gz`, but access is restricted to authorized users."
You are a Frappe Framework expert.,Can you explain what Site Config is in Frappe?,"In Frappe, Site Config refers to the configuration settings that define how a specific Frappe site operates. It's a collection of key-value pairs that control various aspects of the site, from database details to custom domain settings. These settings are stored in a file named `site_config.json`, located within the site directory. This file is automatically created and populated by Frappe when a new site is created. You can further customize it to adjust the behavior of your Frappe site and the applications running on it."
You are a Frappe Framework expert.,I see the `common_site_config.json`. What's its purpose and how does it differ from `site_config.json`?,"The `common_site_config.json` file stores configuration settings that are shared across all sites within a particular Bench instance. This means that any changes made to this file will affect the behavior of all sites managed by that Bench.  The `site_config.json` file, on the other hand, contains site-specific settings. It allows you to override settings from the `common_site_config.json` for individual sites. In case of conflict, the `site_config.json` takes precedence. Think of it as a way to create global defaults for your Bench while allowing you to customize specific sites as needed."
You are a Frappe Framework expert.,I'm trying to understand the concept of config value precedence. Could you provide a clear example?,"Imagine you want to enable the Frappe Web Logger on all the sites in your Bench, except for one specific site named `worker.frappe.xyz` because it's very active.  You can set the `enable_frappe_logger` key to `true` in the `common_site_config.json` file. This will enable the logger for all sites by default. Then, you can specifically disable the logger for `worker.frappe.xyz` by setting `enable_frappe_logger` to `false` in its `site_config.json` file. In this case, the value in `site_config.json` takes precedence, overriding the value in the shared `common_site_config.json` for that particular site."
You are a Frappe Framework expert.,What are some mandatory configuration settings I need to provide when setting up a new Frappe site?,"The following are mandatory configuration settings required when setting up a new Frappe site: 

* `db_type`: This specifies the database type you'll be using, such as 'mariadb' or 'postgres'.
* `db_name`: This is the name of the database you'll be using for your Frappe site. This name is also used as the default database user name.
* `db_password`: This is the password for your database. It's crucial to set a strong password to ensure database security."
You are a Frappe Framework expert.,Can you tell me how to connect to a remote database server using SSL in Frappe?,"To connect to a remote database server using SSL in Frappe, you'll need to first configure the database host to accept SSL connections. This involves setting up SSL certificates and configuring your database server to use them. You can find a detailed tutorial on how to configure SSL for MySQL on Ubuntu 16.04 at [https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-configure-ssl-tls-for-mysql-on-ubuntu-16-04](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-configure-ssl-tls-for-mysql-on-ubuntu-16-04). Once you've configured the database host, you need to set the following three options in your site config:

* `db_host`: This specifies the hostname or IP address of your remote database server.
* `db_port`: This specifies the port number used by your database server.
* `db_ssl_ca`: This is the full path to the `ca.pem` file which contains the SSL certificate authority (CA) certificate. This file is required for Frappe to verify the authenticity of the database server's SSL certificate.
* `db_ssl_cert`: This is the full path to the `cert.pem` file containing your SSL client certificate. This is required if the database server is configured to require client authentication.
* `db_ssl_key`: This is the full path to the `key.pem` file containing your SSL client private key. This is required if the database server is configured to require client authentication. 

By setting these options in your `site_config.json` file, Frappe will attempt to connect to the remote database server using SSL."
You are a Frappe Framework expert.,I'm working with a multi-site setup in Frappe. Is it possible to have different database providers or locations for each site?,"Yes, it's absolutely possible! Frappe's design allows you to have different database solutions, configurations, and even locations for each site within your Bench. This flexibility is achieved through the `site_config.json` file, which stores site-specific database settings. You can use separate database providers for each site and adjust other relevant settings accordingly. This empowers you to tailor the database setup to the specific needs of each site."
You are a Frappe Framework expert.,What are the benefits of using a single application server for multiple Frappe sites?,"Using a single application server for multiple Frappe sites offers several advantages: 

* **Reduced Costs:** You can consolidate your server infrastructure and minimize hardware costs, as you only need to manage and maintain one server. 
* **Simplified Management:**  Managing a single application server simplifies your operational tasks, such as updates, security patches, and monitoring. 
* **Resource Sharing:** Sites can share resources like caches, sessions, and web server instances, leading to potential performance gains. 
* **Scalability:** You can easily scale your application server based on the combined needs of all sites, ensuring optimal performance as your sites grow. 

However, keep in mind that you need to ensure that the server has sufficient resources to handle the combined load of all sites. You'll also need to consider factors like data security and isolation if you have different tenants or sensitive data on different sites."
You are a Frappe Framework expert.,How can I extend the configuration of a Frappe site externally?,"You can extend the configuration of a Frappe site externally by using custom applications. This is particularly useful if you want to avoid hardcoding sensitive values like database passwords directly in the `site_config.json` file. Here's how it works:

1. **Install a Custom App:** Develop or install a custom application that's designed to extend the site configuration. This app should be able to retrieve configuration values from a secure external source, such as a vault or a secret management system.
2. **Configure `extra_config`:** Within the `site_config.json` file, define a key called `extra_config`. This key can be assigned a string representing the path to the configuration hook function within your custom app. Alternatively, you can provide a list of paths if you have multiple configuration hooks.
3. **Implement the Configuration Hook:** In your custom app, create a function named `conf_hook()` that returns a dictionary containing the configuration values you want to append or override. This function should fetch these values from the external source.

By configuring `extra_config` and implementing `conf_hook()`, your custom app will dynamically extend the site configuration during every request to the site. This allows you to manage sensitive configuration values securely and separately from the main `site_config.json` file."
You are a Frappe Framework expert.,What is Audit Trail and how can it be helpful?,"Audit Trail is a tool in Frappe that allows you to track changes made to submittable doctypes across multiple amended versions. It's particularly helpful when a submittable document is cancelled and amended, as tracking changes using the Version doctype becomes challenging due to the document's changing name. With Audit Trail, you can view up to 5 previously amended versions of a submittable doctype."
You are a Frappe Framework expert.,Can you explain the steps involved in using the Audit Trail?,"Absolutely! Here's how to use the Audit Trail:

1. **Select Doctype:** Choose the type of document you want to track in the 'Doctype' field.
2. **Select Document:**  Specify the name of the document from the 'Document' field.
3. **Optional: Set Date Range:** You can optionally select a start and end date to view amended documents within that specific timeframe.
4. **Click Compare:** Once you've made your selections, click the 'Compare' button to view the Audit Trail for the chosen document."
You are a Frappe Framework expert.,What kind of information is displayed in the Audit Trail?,"The Audit Trail presents a comprehensive view of changes across different versions. It includes:

* **Fields Changed:**  Displays the values that have been modified for fields within the document.
* **Rows Updated:**  Shows changes in the values of child table fields across versions.
* **Rows Added / Rows Removed:**  Lists rows that have been added or deleted from child tables in each version."
You are a Frappe Framework expert.,Where can I find more information about the Audit Trail feature in Frappe?,You can find a detailed guide on the Audit Trail feature in the Frappe Framework documentation. Here's the reference URL: [https://frappeframework.com/docs/user/en/audit-trail](https://frappeframework.com/docs/user/en/audit-trail).
You are a Frappe framework expert.,What is Docstatus?,"Docstatus is a concept in Frappe used to track the status of transactions. It essentially determines whether a document is a draft, submitted, or cancelled, each having a specific integer value."
You are a Frappe framework expert.,Can you elaborate on the different Docstatus values?,"Certainly. The three Docstatus values are:

1. **Draft (value: 0):** This represents an incomplete document that is not yet ready for submission. It's often used for initial creation and data entry.
2. **Submitted (value: 1):** This indicates that the document is complete and has been officially submitted. It's generally considered finalized and may trigger workflow actions.
3. **Cancelled (value: 2):** This means the document has been voided or revoked. It's typically used to undo or cancel a previously submitted document."
You are a Frappe framework expert.,What are the implications of a document being in 'Submitted' or 'Cancelled' states?,"Once a document is in a 'Submitted' or 'Cancelled' state, it generally becomes read-only. You can't directly edit the document. However, there is a provision to allow edits for individual fields even when the document is submitted. This is helpful for making specific adjustments while maintaining the document's official status."
You are a Frappe framework expert.,Where can I find more information on how Docstatus works in Frappe?,"You can find a detailed explanation of Docstatus, including code examples, on the official Frappe Framework documentation. Here's the link for your reference: [https://frappeframework.com/docs/user/en/basics/doctypes/docstatus](https://frappeframework.com/docs/user/en/basics/doctypes/docstatus)"
You are a Frappe framework expert.,Can you provide an example of how to use the `DocStatus` class in Python?,"Certainly.  Let's say you want to find all draft invoices in your system.

```python
import frappe
from frappe.model.docstatus import DocStatus

draft_invoice_names = frappe.get_list(
    ""Sales Invoice"",
    filters = {""docstatus"": DocStatus.draft()},
    pluck = ""name""
)
```

This code snippet uses the `DocStatus.draft()` method to filter for invoices with a 'draft' status, retrieving their names. You can then use these names to access and manipulate specific invoice documents."
You are a Frappe framework expert.,What is a module in Frappe?,"A module in Frappe is a way to group related DocTypes together. This makes it easier to manage and organize your application. For example, the 'Core' module contains DocTypes like 'DocType', 'DocField', 'Report', and 'System Settings', while the 'Desk' module contains DocTypes like 'ToDo', 'Event', 'Note', and 'Kanban Board'.  The modules also help to organize the code files, ensuring that the controller files for a specific DocType are located within its respective module directory."
You are a Frappe framework expert.,Can you explain how modules are structured in Frappe's file system?,"Each module in Frappe has its own directory within the 'frappe' folder. For instance, the 'core' module would be located in the 'frappe/core' directory.  Within this directory, you'll find subdirectories like 'doctype', 'page', and 'report', which contain the code for the different DocTypes, pages, and reports associated with that module."
You are a Frappe framework expert.,"I'm curious, how many built-in modules does Frappe come with?","Frappe comes with a large number of built-in modules.  Some of the key modules include 'Core', 'Desk', 'Email', 'Website', and 'Workflow'.  You can also find more specific modules related to inventory, accounting, manufacturing, and so on. For a more complete list, you can refer to the official documentation on [https://frappeframework.com/docs/user/en/basics/doctypes/modules](https://frappeframework.com/docs/user/en/basics/doctypes/modules)."
You are a Frappe framework expert.,Can I create my own modules in Frappe?,"Yes, absolutely! Frappe allows you to create custom modules to extend its functionality and build your own applications. You can create new DocTypes, pages, and reports within your custom module, and even include your own Python code and Javascript files. You can find detailed instructions on how to create custom modules in the official Frappe documentation, which can be accessed at [https://frappeframework.com/docs/user/en/basics/doctypes/modules](https://frappeframework.com/docs/user/en/basics/doctypes/modules)."
"You are an expert on the Frappe Framework, specifically on the concept of Virtual DocFields.",What is a Virtual DocField? Why are they useful?,"A Virtual DocField is a dynamic attribute of a Document (or Record) within the Frappe Framework. It's a calculated value that isn't stored directly in the database. This means it's computed on-the-fly, based on other existing data in the document or from external sources. Virtual DocFields are useful for representing values that are derived from other data, such as calculated fields, or data fetched from external services."
"You are an expert on the Frappe Framework, specifically on the concept of Virtual DocFields.",Can you give me an example of how a Virtual DocField could be used? I'm trying to understand the practical application.,"Imagine you have a 'Person' DocType in your Frappe application. You store the person's first and last name in separate fields. You could create a Virtual DocField called 'Full Name' that automatically combines the first and last name values whenever it's needed, for example, in a form view. This avoids storing redundant data and allows for dynamic updates based on changes to the first or last name."
"You are an expert on the Frappe Framework, specifically on the concept of Virtual DocFields.",How do I actually define a Virtual DocField in Frappe?,"Defining a Virtual DocField is pretty straightforward. When you're creating or editing a DocField in your DocType, you'll find a checkbox labeled 'Virtual'. Simply check this box to mark the field as virtual. This tells the Frappe framework that the field's value will be dynamically calculated rather than stored directly in the database."
"You are an expert on the Frappe Framework, specifically on the concept of Virtual DocFields.","Okay, so I've marked a field as virtual. What's the next step? How do I define what the field will actually show?","Now that you've marked the field as virtual, you need to define the logic for how its value is calculated. There are two primary ways to achieve this:

1. **By Extending DocType Controllers:** You can add a Python property with the same name as your virtual field within the DocType's controller class. This is the most flexible approach, allowing you to perform more complex computations, integrate with external APIs, and fetch data from various sources. 

2. **Using the `DocField.options`:** This method is less flexible but allows you to write code directly from the Frappe 'Desk' interface. It's suitable for simpler calculations where you can access document attributes and use the 'Utils' available in Server Scripts. This is generally preferred for smaller scripting tasks. 

You can choose the method that best suits your needs and complexity."
"You are an expert on the Frappe Framework, specifically on the concept of Virtual DocFields.",I'm reading about how Virtual DocFields impact the internals of Frappe. Can you explain that in a bit more detail? How does it affect database queries and APIs?,"Here's how Virtual DocFields impact the internal workings of Frappe:

* **Backend API:** When you perform queries using the `DatabaseQuery` methods or `Database` APIs, virtual values are not returned. Since they aren't stored in the database, these APIs only retrieve the data that's actually persisted in the tables.

* **REST API:** Frappe's REST API endpoints like `/api/method/frappe.desk.form.load.getdoc` and `/api/resource` rely on the `Document.get_valid_dict` method. This method is designed to handle virtual fields and will compute their values dynamically before returning the document data. These APIs are also used to render the 'Desk' form views, so you'll see the virtual field values reflected there.

* **Database:** There is no explicit entry for Virtual DocFields in the database tables associated with your DocTypes. Their existence is tracked in the `Custom Field` and `DocField` tables, which store the metadata about your DocType's structure. 

In essence, Virtual DocFields are 'on-demand' calculations that aren't stored persistently but are dynamically generated when needed."
"You are an expert on the Frappe Framework, specifically on the concept of Virtual DocFields.",I'm a little hesitant about using Virtual DocFields. Are there any potential downsides or things I should be aware of?,"While Virtual DocFields offer flexibility and efficiency, there are a couple of points to consider:

1. **Performance:**  Computing virtual values dynamically can potentially add overhead, especially if the calculations are complex or involve fetching data from external sources. If you're dealing with large datasets or performance is critical, carefully evaluate the impact of your virtual field computations.

2. **Read-Only:**  Virtual DocFields are inherently read-only in form views. You cannot directly edit them because their values are calculated on-the-fly.  

3. **Avoid Existing Fields:**  It's generally not recommended to convert existing DocFields that are already storing data into virtual fields. This could lead to data loss or unexpected behavior, as existing data might not be recalculated correctly. 

It's best to weigh the benefits of Virtual DocFields against these potential considerations to make an informed decision for your application."
You are a Frappe Framework expert.,What are field types in Frappe Framework?,"Field types in Frappe Framework are different data types used to capture and store information within documents. They determine how data is presented, validated, and processed within your application. Each field type has a specific use case and rendering behavior in forms and views."
You are a Frappe Framework expert.,Can you tell me about the 'Data' field type?,"The 'Data' field type is a simple text field that allows you to enter up to 140 characters. It's the most generic field type and can be used for various purposes. You can also add validations like 'Name', 'Email', 'Phone', or 'URL' to ensure data integrity."
You are a Frappe Framework expert.,What is the difference between 'Link' and 'Dynamic Link' field types?,"'Link' field types connect to a specific master DocType and fetch data from it. For instance, the 'Customer' field in a 'Quotation' DocType is a 'Link' field. On the other hand, 'Dynamic Link' field types allow you to search and select data from any document or DocType. You can learn more about Dynamic Link fields [here](https://erpnext.com/docs/user/manual/en/customize-erpnext/articles/dynamic-link-fields)."
You are a Frappe Framework expert.,How can I create a dropdown menu using a field type?,"You can use the 'Select' field type to create a dropdown menu. In the 'Options' field, define each selectable value, separated by a newline.  You can also set a default value in the 'Default' field, which will be pre-selected in new forms. Additionally, you can enable 'Sort Options' to display values alphabetically in the user's language."
You are a Frappe Framework expert.,What is the purpose of the 'Table' field type?,"The 'Table' field type allows you to render another DocType as a child table within your form. You'll need to choose or define a DocType that has the 'Is Child Table' checkbox enabled. Then, in the 'Options' field of your 'Table' field, you can paste the name of the child table DocType."
You are a Frappe Framework expert.,I'm interested in the 'Code' field type. What are its uses?,"The 'Code' field type is used to take code as input. It renders a code editor within the document form, allowing you to write and edit code directly. You can optionally specify a language in the 'Options' field to enable syntax highlighting and validation. For example, you can use 'Python' for scripts or 'PythonExpression' for simple one-line expressions that need to evaluate to a value."
You are a Frappe Framework expert.,Can you explain the 'Geolocation' field type?,"The 'Geolocation' field type allows you to store geographic data, including points, lines, and polygons, using GeoJSON. It renders a map view where you can draw these features. If you name the field 'location', Frappe will automatically create an additional map view, similar to a list view, but on a map. This also works if you have separate 'latitude' and 'longitude' fields. Remember that Frappe uses Leaflet, which stores coordinates as [latitude, longitude], the reverse of the GeoJSON standard."
You are a Frappe Framework expert.,I'm working on a document with sensitive information. Which field type is best for storing passwords?,"For storing sensitive data like passwords, passphrases, or secret keys, you should use the 'Password' field type. This type of field stores the value in a decoded format, providing an additional layer of security."
You are a Frappe Framework expert.,What is the purpose of 'Section Break' and 'Tab Break' field types?,"'Section Break' and 'Tab Break' field types are not used to store data but rather to improve the structure and organization of your forms. 'Section Break' divides the form into multiple sections, grouping related fields together. 'Tab Break' creates tabs that allow you to present form fields in a more organized manner, especially for forms with many fields."
You are a Frappe Framework expert.,Where can I find more documentation on Frappe Framework field types?,"You can find comprehensive documentation on Frappe Framework field types [here](https://frappeframework.com/docs/user/en/basics/doctypes/fieldtypes). This documentation provides detailed explanations of each field type, including their features, uses, and examples."
You are a Frappe Framework expert.,What is the purpose of 'name' in Frappe DocTypes?,"In Frappe, every DocType has a primary key called 'name'. It acts as a unique identifier for each record within the system. This allows you to easily find and manipulate data using the Frappe ORM (Object Relational Mapper)."
You are a Frappe Framework expert.,I'm creating a new DocType. How can I configure how documents are named?,"You have several options for configuring document naming in Frappe. You can use the 'autoname' property of the DocType, define a naming series, or use a custom naming format. You can even create a controller method to handle naming programatically. Additionally, you can set up Document Naming Rules for more granular control over how specific types of documents are named."
You are a Frappe Framework expert.,Explain how to use the 'autoname' property of a DocType to name documents.,"The 'autoname' property allows you to define how documents within that DocType will be named. There are a few different ways to use 'autoname':

1. **field:[fieldname]** - The document name is derived from the value of a specific field you specify.
2. **[series]** -  A naming pattern is automatically generated using a series (e.g., 'PRE.#####' results in names like 'PRE00001', 'PRE00002', etc.).
3. **naming_series:** - The naming pattern is based on the value of a field named 'naming_series' within the document itself. This allows you to have different patterns for different documents.
4. **Prompt** - This requires you to manually enter a name for each document. 
5. **Format** - This option provides the most flexibility, letting you create custom naming schemes using placeholders and keywords like month, field values, and auto-generated series."
You are a Frappe Framework expert.,I'd like to use the 'Format' option in 'autoname'. Can you provide an example?,"Sure, let's say you want your documents named like this: `EXAMPLE-{MM}-test-{fieldname1}-{fieldname2}-{#####}`.

* `EXAMPLE-{MM}-test-` is plain text that will be included directly in the name.
* `{MM}` will be replaced by the current month.
* `{fieldname1}` and `{fieldname2}` will be replaced by the values of the corresponding fields in your document.
* `{#####}` will generate a series that starts with `00001` and increments with each new document. 

So, the final name might look like `EXAMPLE-02-test-value1-value2-00001`."
You are a Frappe Framework expert.,Can I create a custom naming rule for a specific DocType?,"Yes, you can create Document Naming Rules to define custom naming schemes for specific DocTypes. These rules can be applied based on conditions you set, allowing you to have more control over how certain documents are named."
You are a Frappe Framework expert.,What information do I need to provide when creating a Document Naming Rule?,"When creating a Document Naming Rule, you'll need to specify the following:

1. **Document Type:** The DocType the rule will be applied to.
2. **Priority:** The order in which this rule will be applied relative to other rules (higher priority rules are applied first).
3. **Conditions:** The criteria that must be met for the rule to be applied (e.g., based on field values, document status, etc.).
4. **Naming Rules:**  The specific naming pattern to be used for documents matching the conditions. You can define prefixes, numbers of digits, and other elements."
You are a Frappe Framework expert.,What is the naming priority if I have multiple ways to name a document?,"The naming priority in Frappe is as follows:

1. **Document Naming Rule:** If a rule matches the conditions for the current document, it takes precedence.
2. **`autoname` controller method:**  If you have a custom `autoname` method defined in the DocType's controller class, it will be used if no Document Naming Rule applies.
3. **`autoname` DocType property:** The 'autoname' property defined in the DocType itself is the lowest priority option. It will be used only if no Document Naming Rule or controller method is present."
You are a Frappe Framework expert.,Are there any special rules for naming child DocTypes or amended documents?,"Yes, there are some special rules:

1. **Child DocTypes:** Child DocTypes do not follow the same naming rules as their parent DocTypes. They have their own unique naming conventions.
2. **Amended documents:**  When a document is amended, a suffix is added to the original document name (e.g., '-1', '-2', etc.). This helps to track different versions of the same document."
You are a Frappe Framework expert.,What is a DocField?,"A DocField is like a blueprint for a property or field within a DocType. It defines essential details such as the field's name, label, data type, and whether it's mandatory. Think of it as a way to structure the data that you'll store in your application."
You are a Frappe Framework expert.,Can you give me an example of how DocFields are used in a DocType?,"Sure. Let's take a 'ToDo' DocType as an example. It might have fields like 'description', 'status', and 'priority'. These DocFields would define the properties of each ToDo item, and ultimately become columns in the database table named 'tabToDo'."
You are a Frappe Framework expert.,"I see. So, what are some key properties we can define within a DocField?","Great question! Here are some of the important DocField properties: 

* **label**: This is the user-friendly name displayed in the interface, like 'Description' or 'Priority'.
* **fieldname**: This is the internal name used in code and database, such as 'description' or 'priority'.
* **fieldtype**: This determines the type of data stored and the way it's presented, for example, 'Text Editor', 'Select', or 'Currency'.
* **reqd**: This specifies whether the field is mandatory (1) or not (0)."
You are a Frappe Framework expert.,"I noticed some properties like 'depends_on', 'mandatory_depends_on', and 'read_only_depends_on'. What are they for?","These properties are used for conditional behavior.  

* **depends_on**: This determines whether a field is displayed or hidden based on a condition. For instance, a 'Completed By' field might only be shown if the 'status' is set to 'Closed'.
* **mandatory_depends_on**: This property makes a field mandatory only when a specific condition is met. This allows you to create flexible forms.
* **read_only_depends_on**: This makes a field read-only based on a given condition. This can be useful for preventing accidental changes."
You are a Frappe Framework expert.,That's really helpful. Where can I find more information about DocFields and the different field types available?,You can explore more about DocFields and the various field types on the Frappe Framework documentation page: [https://frappeframework.com/docs/user/en/basics/doctypes/docfield](https://frappeframework.com/docs/user/en/basics/doctypes/docfield). It's a great resource to learn about the different options and how to use them effectively.
You are a Frappe Framework expert.,What are Controllers in Frappe Framework?,"In Frappe, Controllers are regular Python classes that extend the `frappe.model.Document` base class. They act as the central logic for a DocType. Basically, they handle how data is retrieved from the database, parsed, and saved back."
You are a Frappe Framework expert.,Can you give me an example of how a Controller is created?,"Sure. When you create a DocType named 'Person', Frappe automatically generates a Python file named 'person.py'.  Inside this file, you'll find the Controller class like this:

```python
import frappe
from frappe.model.document import Document

class Person(Document):
    pass
```

This simple structure sets up your basic Controller. You can then add custom methods and hooks to define its behavior."
You are a Frappe Framework expert.,How do I add custom methods to a Controller?,"You can define custom methods within the Controller class. These methods can be accessed and called using the `doc` object. For example:

```python
class Person(Document):
    def get_full_name(self):
        """"""Returns the person's full name""""""
        return f""{self.first_name} {self.last_name}""
```

Later in your code, you can use this method like this:

```python
doc = frappe.get_doc(""Person"", ""000001"")
doc.get_full_name()
```"
You are a Frappe Framework expert.,"What are Controller Hooks, and why are they useful?","Controller Hooks are special methods that trigger automatically at different stages of a document's lifecycle. This lets you add custom logic to handle events like insertion, validation, submission, and deletion. They provide a structured way to control how your DocTypes behave without directly modifying the core save and update methods. You can find a detailed list of available hooks and their descriptions in the Frappe documentation. ([https://frappeframework.com/docs/user/en/basics/doctypes/controllers](https://frappeframework.com/docs/user/en/basics/doctypes/controllers))"
You are a Frappe Framework expert.,Can you give me an example of a Controller Hook in action?,"Sure. Let's say you want to add a validation rule to a 'Person' DocType, ensuring that the person's age is at least 18. You can use the `validate` hook for this:

```python
class Person(Document):
    def validate(self):
        if self.age <= 18:
            frappe.throw(""Person's age must be at least 18"")
```

This code will be executed before the document is saved, and if the age condition isn't met, it will prevent the save and throw an error message."
You are a Frappe Framework expert.,What are Type Annotations in Controllers and how are they used?,"Type Annotations, introduced in Frappe Version 15, are a way to add type hints to your Controller code. This helps with auto-completion, better code understanding, and type checking during development. Frappe automatically generates these annotations when you create or modify a DocType. For instance:

```python
class Person(Document):
    # begin: auto-generated types
    # This code is auto-generated. Do not modify anything in this block.

    from typing import TYPE_CHECKING

    if TYPE_CHECKING:
        from frappe.types import DF

        first_name: DF.Data
        last_name: DF.Data 
        user: DF.Link
    # end: auto-generated types
    pass
```

You can configure the automatic exporting of these annotations by adding `export_python_type_annotations = True` to your `hooks.py` file."
You are a Frappe Framework expert.,I want to learn more about type annotations. Where can I find resources?,"You can find detailed information on Python type annotations in the official Python documentation: [https://docs.python.org/3/library/typing.html](https://docs.python.org/3/library/typing.html). For VS Code users, the Python extension provides excellent auto-completion features. You can find more about it here: [https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/languages/python](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/languages/python). Most other editors offer similar plugins that use the Language Server Protocol (LSP) for type-related features."
You are a Frappe Framework expert.,Can you explain what 'Form & View Settings' are in Frappe?,"Form & View Settings in Frappe are a way to customize how your data is displayed and edited. You can control things like what fields are shown, how they are arranged, and what options users have when interacting with them."
You are a Frappe Framework expert.,What is the 'Title Field' in Frappe?,The 'Title Field' is a specific field within a DocType that is used to display the main title or name of the record. It's what you'll see in lists and other views.
You are a Frappe Framework expert.,How do I set the title field in Frappe?,"To set the title field, you go to the 'Form & View Settings' of your DocType. There's a section called 'Title Field' where you can enter the name of the custom field that you want to use as the title. You can refer to the documentation for more visual guidance: [https://frappeframework.com/docs/user/en/basics/doctypes/form_&_view_settings](https://frappeframework.com/docs/user/en/basics/doctypes/form_&_view_settings)."
You are a Frappe Framework expert.,What does 'Show Title in Link Fields' do in Frappe?,'Show Title in Link Fields' allows you to display the title of a linked document instead of its name in 'Link Fields'. This can make your forms more user-friendly by showing a descriptive title instead of a potentially cryptic name.
You are a Frappe Framework expert.,Can you give me an example of when 'Show Title in Link Fields' would be useful?,"Imagine you have a DocType called 'Customer' with a 'Name' field and a 'Title' field. If you link a Customer to another DocType, and 'Show Title in Link Fields' is enabled, you'll see the Customer's Title in the linked field, making it clearer who that customer is."
You are a Frappe Framework expert.,Can you explain what a Child DocType is in Frappe?,"A Child DocType in Frappe is a type of document that can only be linked to a parent DocType. This creates a many-to-one relationship, allowing you to store multiple related records for a single parent record. For example, if you have a 'Customer' DocType, you might have a 'Order' Child DocType to store multiple orders for a specific customer."
You are a Frappe Framework expert.,How do I create a Child DocType in Frappe?,"To create a Child DocType in Frappe, you need to check the 'Is Child Table' option while creating the DocType. This will indicate that it's a Child DocType and can only be linked to a parent DocType. You can find this option in the DocType creation interface."
You are a Frappe Framework expert.,How do I link a Child DocType to its parent?,"To link a Child DocType to its parent, you need to create a 'Table' field in the parent DocType. When configuring this field, choose the option 'Child Table'. This field will then allow you to associate multiple child records with the parent document."
You are a Frappe Framework expert.,What are the properties of a Child DocType?,"Child DocTypes have specific properties that define their relationship with their parent. These include: 

* **parent**: The name of the parent document.
* **parenttype**: The DocType of the parent document.
* **parentfield**: The field in the parent document that links this child to it.
* **idx**: The sequence number (row) of the child record within the parent document."
You are a Frappe Framework expert.,Where can I find more information about Child DocTypes in Frappe?,You can find detailed information on Child DocTypes in the Frappe Framework documentation at https://frappeframework.com/docs/user/en/basics/doctypes/child-doctype. This documentation provides comprehensive explanations and examples to help you understand and utilize Child DocTypes effectively.
You are a Frappe Framework expert.,What is a Single DocType?,"A Single DocType is a type of DocType that has only one instance in the database. This means there can only be one record for that DocType. It's useful for storing things like system settings, which wouldn't make sense to have multiple records for. For example, you might have a 'System Settings' Single DocType to store your application's global configuration."
You are a Frappe Framework expert.,Can you give me an example of how a Single DocType is used?,"Sure. The example provided in the documentation shows how you can access the 'System Settings' Single DocType using Python code. You can use `frappe.get_doc('System Settings')` to retrieve the settings object, and then access its properties like `settings.notification_frequency` to get the value of the 'notification_frequency' field. This allows you to easily manage and access system-wide configurations within your application."
You are a Frappe Framework expert.,Where is data for Single DocTypes stored in the database?,"The data for Single DocTypes is stored in the `tabSingles` table. Each property of the Single DocType has its own record in this table, with columns for `doctype`, `field`, and `value`."
You are a Frappe Framework expert.,Where can I find more information about Single DocTypes?,"You can find more detailed information about Single DocTypes on the official Frappe Framework documentation website. The specific page for this topic is located at https://frappeframework.com/docs/user/en/basics/doctypes/single-doctype. This page provides a comprehensive explanation of Single DocTypes, including examples, schema details, and how to use them effectively in your applications."
You are a Frappe Framework expert.,What are Virtual DocTypes in Frappe?,"Virtual DocTypes are a powerful feature in Frappe that allows you to create custom DocTypes without needing to create a table in the database. They act like regular DocTypes in the frontend, giving users a seamless experience. However, they provide developers with greater control over the data source for the DocType."
You are a Frappe Framework expert.,What are the advantages of using Virtual DocTypes?,"Virtual DocTypes offer several advantages. You can define custom DocTypes without creating database tables, making development faster and more flexible. They also allow you to use various data sources, including external APIs, secondary databases, JSON or CSV files, and more. This expands the framework's capabilities and enables you to integrate with different data backends."
You are a Frappe Framework expert.,How do I create a Virtual DocType in Frappe?,"When creating a new DocType in Frappe, simply check the 'Virtual DocType' checkbox. This will enable you to define the DocType without creating a database table."
You are a Frappe Framework expert.,Can you give an example of how to create a custom controller for a Virtual DocType?,"Sure. The documentation provides an example using a JSON file as the data source. You can define a custom controller class that handles data operations like fetching, inserting, updating, and deleting data. This class would interact with the JSON file directly, providing a custom backend for your Virtual DocType."
You are a Frappe Framework expert.,Can you give me some examples of how Virtual DocTypes could be used in a real-world scenario?,"Certainly.  Virtual DocTypes can be used for various purposes. For instance, you could create a Virtual DocType to represent data from an external API, such as a weather forecast service. This allows you to integrate external data into your Frappe application. Additionally, you could use them to manage data from a secondary database, allowing you to combine data from different sources within your Frappe app. The possibilities are quite extensive!"
You are a Frappe Framework expert.,What are Actions and Links in Frappe Framework?,"Actions and Links, also known as Connections, are features in Frappe Framework that enhance user interaction with documents. They provide ways to trigger specific actions or navigate to related documents, making the application more dynamic and user-friendly. You can find more details about them in the official documentation at [https://frappeframework.com/docs/user/en/basics/doctypes/actions-and-links](https://frappeframework.com/docs/user/en/basics/doctypes/actions-and-links)."
You are a Frappe Framework expert.,Can you explain different types of Actions in Frappe Framework?,"Sure! In Frappe Framework, there are two main types of Actions:

1. **Server Action:** This action triggers a server-side function, which is a piece of code that executes on the server. You can use this to perform operations like data manipulation, calculations, or sending emails.

2. **Route:** This action redirects the user to a specific route, which can be another page within the application or an external website. This allows you to easily navigate between different sections of your app or open external resources.

Both types of actions can be configured to provide users with a more interactive experience."
You are a Frappe Framework expert.,How can I create a custom Action in my Frappe app?,"To create a custom Action in your Frappe app, you'll need to follow these steps:

1. **Define a Python Function:** Create a Python function within your app's code, typically in a file like `apps/my_app/my_app/api.py`. Decorate this function with `@frappe.whitelist()`. This tells Frappe that the function is safe to be called from the client-side.

2. **Write the Function Logic:** Inside the function, write the code that will be executed when the custom Action is triggered. For example, you could perform data manipulation or send notifications.

3. **Configure the Action Path:** In the Frappe UI, go to the DocType for which you want to add the action. Open the `Customize Form` for the DocType, find the `Actions and Links` section, and add a new Action. Specify the path to your custom function in the `Action Path` field, making sure it follows the correct format (e.g., `my_app.api.execute_function`).

This configuration will link your custom Python function to the Action button in the DocType View. When the button is clicked, Frappe will call your function, executing the logic you defined."
You are a Frappe Framework expert.,"What are Connections, and how do they help users?","Connections in Frappe Framework are essentially links that show the relationships between different documents. They help users easily navigate and understand how different parts of the application are connected. Here's how Connections benefit users:

1. **Improved Navigation:** Connections provide quick and easy access to related documents, reducing the need to manually search for them.

2. **Enhanced Context:**  By showing linked documents, Connections provide users with more context and a better understanding of the relationships between different data points.

3. **Streamlined Workflows:**  Connections can help users follow specific workflows by easily navigating through connected documents, making processes more efficient.

4. **Data Visibility:**  Users can quickly see which documents are related to the current one, providing a more comprehensive view of the data."
You are a Frappe Framework expert.,Can you explain the difference between internal and external links in Connections?,"Here's the difference between internal and external links within Connections:

**Internal Links:**

- These links connect to other DocTypes that are related to the current one through a child table (e.g., Sales Invoice items are linked to the Sales Order).  This means the connection is established based on data within a specific table related to the main DocType.

**External Links:**

- These links connect to other DocTypes based on a common field or relationship defined in the system. They don't necessarily have a direct child table relationship (e.g., a Delivery Note can be linked to a Sales Invoice even though it doesn't have a specific child table linking them). This connection is based on a common field that exists in both DocTypes.

You can use both internal and external links to create a comprehensive network of relationships between different documents, providing a richer user experience."
You are a Frappe Framework expert.,I'm working with multiple sites using the same Frappe application. How can I customize DocTypes for each site?,"Frappe Framework offers several ways to customize DocTypes for different sites. You can use Custom Fields, Property Setters, Customize Form, Client Scripts, Server Scripts, or Custom DocPerms. Each method has its own advantages and use cases.  For example, Custom Fields allow you to add site-specific fields to a DocType, while Property Setters let you override specific properties for a DocType and its children."
You are a Frappe Framework expert.,Can you tell me more about the Customize Form?,"The Customize Form provides a convenient way to override DocType properties and add Custom Fields in a single view. It's a user-friendly interface that helps streamline the customization process. Any changes made through the Customize Form don't directly modify the underlying DocType; instead, it creates custom objects to override the properties. This ensures seamless integration and avoids conflicts with the original DocType."
You are a Frappe Framework expert.,I noticed the Customize Form allows adding Custom Links and Actions. How does that work?,"You can add or edit Links and Actions through the Customize Form, which are saved within the `DocType Link` and `DocType Action` DocTypes, respectively. However, these entries have a `custom` property set to true, indicating they are site-specific customizations. These custom configurations are automatically applied when fetching metadata using `frappe.get_meta`."
You are a Frappe Framework expert.,Where can I find more detailed information about customizing DocTypes in Frappe Framework?,"You can find comprehensive documentation on customizing DocTypes in the Frappe Framework website at [https://frappeframework.com/docs/user/en/basics/doctypes/customize](https://frappeframework.com/docs/user/en/basics/doctypes/customize). This documentation covers various aspects of DocType customization, including using Custom Fields, Property Setters, Customize Form, and more."
You are a Frappe Framework expert.,How does Frappe handle real-time events?,Frappe utilizes the [socket.io](https://socket.io/) library for real-time events. It runs a Node.js process alongside the main web server to facilitate this real-time functionality.
You are a Frappe Framework expert.,Can you give me an example of how to listen to real-time events in the browser?,"You can use the `frappe.realtime.on` method to subscribe to real-time events. Here's how it looks:

```javascript
frappe.realtime.on('event_name', (data) => {
  console.log(data)
})
```

This code snippet will listen for an event named 'event_name' and log any data associated with that event to the console."
You are a Frappe Framework expert.,How do I publish a real-time event from the server?,"You can use the `frappe.publish_realtime` method on the server side (Python). For example:

```python
frappe.publish_realtime('event_name', data={'key': 'value'})
```

This will publish an event named 'event_name' with the provided data."
You are a Frappe Framework expert.,I'm developing a mobile app that needs to connect to Frappe's real-time server. How can I authenticate my connection?,"You have two main authentication options:

1. **Cookies:** If your mobile app operates within a browser-like environment, cookies will be automatically sent, allowing the socket.io server to authenticate the connection.
2. **Authorization Headers:** For mobile apps where cookies are not available, you can utilize Authorization headers. You can find more details on REST API authentication and how to use headers in the documentation linked here: [https://frappeframework.com/docs/user/en/api/rest#authentication](https://frappeframework.com/docs/user/en/api/rest#authentication) and [https://socket.io/docs/v4/client-options/#extraheaders](https://socket.io/docs/v4/client-options/#extraheaders)."
You are a Frappe Framework expert.,I'm interested in using custom event handlers. How do I set them up?,"Custom event handlers are a powerful feature. You can create a `handlers.js` file within the real-time folder of your app. This file should export a function that sets up event handlers on the socket instance. For example, if your app is called 'chat':

```javascript
// bench/apps/chat/realtime/handlers.js

function chat_app_handlers(socket) {
  socket.on('hello_chat', () => {
    console.log('hello world!');
  });
}

module.exports = chat_app_handlers;
```

Remember that this feature is currently considered experimental and available in nightly (v16) versions of Frappe. You can trigger these custom events from the client side using `frappe.realtime.emit('hello_chat')`."
You are a Frappe Framework expert.,How does Frappe handle background tasks?,"Frappe uses a built-in system for running jobs in the background, leveraging the `schedule` package and a long-running `while` loop. This allows you to execute Python methods asynchronously, without blocking your main application flow."
You are a Frappe Framework expert.,Can you explain how to enqueue a background job using `frappe.enqueue`?,"You can enqueue a Python method to run in the background using the `frappe.enqueue` method. Here's an example:

```python
def long_running_job(param1, param2):
    # expensive tasks
    pass

# directly pass the function
frappe.enqueue(long_running_job, queue='short', param1='A', param2='B')

# or pass the full module path as string
frappe.enqueue('app.module.folder.long_running_job', queue='short', param1='A', param2='B')
```

You can pass the function directly or provide the full module path. The `queue` argument specifies the queue to which the job will be added. You can also use various other parameters like `timeout`, `is_async`, `now`, `job_name`, etc. to customize the execution of your job."
You are a Frappe Framework expert.,What are the different queues available in Frappe?,"Frappe provides three default queues: `short`, `default`, and `long`. Each queue has a default timeout:

* **short:** 300 seconds
* **default:** 300 seconds
* **long:** 1500 seconds

You can also define custom queues by modifying the `common_site_config.json` file."
You are a Frappe Framework expert.,Can I specify a custom timeout for a background job?,"Yes, you can set a custom timeout for a background job by passing the `timeout` parameter to the `frappe.enqueue` method. This allows you to control the maximum time the job will be allowed to run before it is considered to have failed."
You are a Frappe Framework expert.,How do I define a custom queue in Frappe?,"To define a custom queue, you need to modify the `common_site_config.json` file in your Frappe installation. Here's an example:

```json
{
  ...
  ""workers"": {
    ""myqueue"": {
      ""timeout"": 5000, // queue timeout
      ""background_workers"": 4, // number of workers for this queue
    }
  }
}
```

This configuration creates a custom queue called `myqueue` with a timeout of 5000 seconds and 4 dedicated workers."
You are a Frappe Framework expert.,Can I enqueue a Document method as a background job?,"Yes, you can enqueue a Document method using the `frappe.enqueue_doc` method. This allows you to run controller methods associated with a specific document in the background. Here's an example:

```python
frappe.enqueue_doc(
    doctype='MyDocType',
    name='MyDocName',
    method='do_something',
    queue='long',
    timeout=4000,
    param='value'
)
```

This will enqueue the `do_something` method of the `MyDocType` with the name `MyDocName` on the `long` queue with a timeout of 4000 seconds."
You are a Frappe Framework expert.,"What are worker processes in Frappe, and how are they used?","Worker processes in Frappe are responsible for consuming jobs from the queues. By default, Frappe sets up three worker types: `short`, `default`, and `long`, corresponding to the queues. These processes are replicated to handle higher workloads in production. You can configure workers to consume from multiple queues by specifying a comma-separated list of queue names.

For example, to combine `short` and `default` workers, you can run:

```bash
bench worker --queue short,default
bench worker --queue long
```"
You are a Frappe Framework expert.,What is the purpose of the `--burst` option when running a worker process?,The `--burst` option creates a temporary worker process that consumes jobs from a specified queue until the queue is empty. This is useful for handling spikes in workload or for running a specific job once. You can schedule these burst workers using your OS's crontab to execute them periodically.
You are a Frappe Framework expert.,How can I schedule tasks to run periodically in Frappe?,"You can schedule tasks to run periodically using Scheduler Events. These events are defined in your application's `hooks.py` file using the `scheduler_events` hook. Here's an example:

```python
scheduler_events = {
    ""hourly"": [
        # will run hourly
        ""app.scheduled_tasks.update_database_usage""
    ],
}
```

This will execute the `update_database_usage` function every hour. You can define various other events like `daily`, `weekly`, `monthly`, `hourly_long`, `daily_long`, and even use a cron string for more specific scheduling. Make sure to run `bench migrate` after making changes to your `hooks.py` file."
You are a Frappe Framework expert.,What are the available Scheduler Events in Frappe?,"Frappe offers a variety of Scheduler Events to execute tasks at specific intervals:

* **`hourly`, `daily`, `weekly`, `monthly`**: These events trigger every hour, day, week, and month respectively.
* **`hourly_long`, `daily_long`, `weekly_long`, `monthly_long`**: Similar to the above events but run in the `long` worker, suitable for long-running tasks.
* **`all`**: Triggered every 4 minutes (configurable via the `scheduler_interval` key in `common_site_config.json`).
* **`cron`**: Allows you to use a cron string that can be parsed by the `croniter` library for precise scheduling.

You can define these events in your `hooks.py` file using the `scheduler_events` hook."
You are a Frappe framework expert.,Can you tell me what a Document is in Frappe?,"In Frappe, a Document is an instance of a DocType. It's essentially a single record within a database table. Think of it as a row in a spreadsheet, but it's backed by the power of the Frappe framework."
You are a Frappe framework expert.,I need to retrieve a specific document. How can I do that using the Frappe API?,"You can use the `frappe.get_doc` function to retrieve a Document object. You need to provide the `doctype` and the `name` of the document. For example, to retrieve a document with the `doctype` 'Task' and `name` 'TASK00002', you would use:

```python
 doc = frappe.get_doc('Task', 'TASK00002')
```"
You are a Frappe framework expert.,I'm working with Single DocTypes. Do I need to provide the name when using `frappe.get_doc`?,"No, you don't need to provide the name when working with Single DocTypes. Frappe will automatically fetch the single instance of that DocType. For example, you can retrieve the 'System Settings' DocType with:

```python
 doc = frappe.get_doc('System Settings')
```"
You are a Frappe framework expert.,What if I need to create a new document? How would I do that using the API?,"You can create a new Document using `frappe.get_doc` with a dictionary containing the `doctype` and any initial fields. For example, to create a new Task with the title 'New Task':

```python
 doc = frappe.get_doc({ 'doctype': 'Task', 'title': 'New Task' })
 doc.insert()
```

You can also use keyword arguments:

```python
 user = frappe.get_doc(doctype='User', email_id='test@example.com')
 user.insert()
```"
You are a Frappe framework expert.,How can I get the last created document of a specific type?,"Use the `frappe.get_last_doc` function. You need to provide the `doctype`. You can optionally add `filters` to narrow down the search and specify the `order_by` field to control the sorting. For example, to get the last created Task:

```python
 task = frappe.get_last_doc('Task')
```

To get the last canceled Task:

```python
 task = frappe.get_last_doc('Task', filters={'status': 'Cancelled'})
```

To retrieve the last Task based on a field named 'timestamp':

```python
 task = frappe.get_last_doc('Task', filters={'Status': 'Cancelled'}, order_by='timestamp desc')
```"
You are a Frappe framework expert.,What does `frappe.get_cached_doc` do?,It's very similar to `frappe.get_doc` but it first checks the cache for the document before querying the database. This can improve performance if the document is frequently accessed.
You are a Frappe framework expert.,Is there another way to create a new document besides using `frappe.get_doc`?,"Yes, you can use the `frappe.new_doc` function. This function takes the `doctype` as an argument and returns a new Document object. For example, to create a new Task:

```python
 doc = frappe.new_doc('Task')
 doc.title = 'New Task 2'
 doc.insert()
```"
You are a Frappe framework expert.,How do I delete a document from the database?,"You can use the `frappe.delete_doc` function. It requires the `doctype` and `name` of the document you want to delete. For example:

```python
 frappe.delete_doc('Task', 'TASK00002')
```

You can also delete a document using the `doc.delete()` method, which is an alias to `frappe.delete_doc`."
You are a Frappe framework expert.,I need to rename a document. How can I do that using the API?,"Use the `frappe.rename_doc` function. You need to provide the `doctype`, the `old_name`, and the `new_name` of the document. You can also specify `merge=True` to merge the renamed document with an existing one that has the same name. For example:

```python
 frappe.rename_doc('Task', 'TASK00002', 'TASK00003')
```

Remember that renaming will only work if the 'Allow Rename' option is enabled in the DocType Form."
You are a Frappe framework expert.,I'm interested in getting meta information about a DocType. How do I do that?,"Use the `frappe.get_meta` function. It takes the `doctype` as an argument and returns a meta object containing information about the DocType, including custom fields and property setters. For example:

```python
 meta = frappe.get_meta('Task')
 meta.has_field('status')  # True
 meta.get_custom_fields()  # [field1, field2, ..]
```

To access the original DocType definition without custom fields or property setters, use `frappe.get_doc('DocType', doctype_name)`."
You are a Frappe framework expert.,Can you explain the `doc.insert` method?,"The `doc.insert` method is used to insert a new document into the database. It will check for user permissions and run any relevant controller methods (`before_insert`, `validate`, `on_update`, `after_insert`). You can use various options to bypass certain checks:

* `ignore_permissions=True`: Ignores write permissions during insertion.
* `ignore_links=True`: Ignores Link validation within the document.
* `ignore_if_duplicate=True`: Prevents insertion if a DuplicateEntryError is thrown.
* `ignore_mandatory=True`: Allows insertion even if mandatory fields are not set."
You are a Frappe framework expert.,What about `doc.save`? How does it differ from `doc.insert`?,`doc.save` is used to save changes to an existing document. It checks user permissions and runs the `validate` method before updating the document and the `on_update` method after. You can use options like `ignore_permissions=True` to ignore write permissions and `ignore_version=True` to avoid creating a version record.
You are a Frappe framework expert.,What are some other useful methods available for working with Document objects?,"Here are some other useful methods:

* `doc.delete()`: Deletes the document from the database. It's an alias to `frappe.delete_doc`.
* `doc.get_doc_before_save()`: Returns a copy of the document before any changes were made, allowing you to compare changes.
* `doc.reload()`: Fetches the latest values from the database and updates the document's state.
* `doc.check_permission(permtype='write')`: Throws an error if the current user doesn't have the specified permission (in this case, write permission) for the document.
* `doc.get_title()`: Returns the document title based on the `title_field` or fields named 'title' or 'name'.
* `doc.notify_update()`: Publishes a real-time event indicating that the document has been modified. This allows clients to update their forms accordingly.
* `doc.db_set('price', 2300)`: Sets a field value directly in the database, updating the modified timestamp. Use with caution as it bypasses controller validations."
You are a Frappe framework expert.,Can you explain the `doc.append` method?,"The `doc.append` method is used to add a new item to a child table within a document. You provide the name of the child table and a dictionary containing the values for the child table fields. For example:

```python
 doc.append('childtable', {'child_table_field': 'value', 'child_table_int_field': 0})
```"
You are a Frappe framework expert.,"What about methods related to comments, tags, and views?","You can use the following methods:

* `doc.add_comment(comment_type, text)`: Adds a comment to the document. You can specify the comment type (e.g., 'Comment', 'Edit', 'Shared') and the text of the comment.
* `doc.add_seen(user_email)`: Adds a user to the list of users who have seen the document, updating the `_seen` column.
* `doc.add_viewed(user_email)`: Logs a view event when a user opens the document form.
* `doc.add_tag(tag)`: Adds a tag to the document.
* `doc.get_tags()`: Returns a list of tags associated with the document."
You are a Frappe framework expert.,How can I run a custom method defined in a document's controller?,"You can use the `doc.run_method(method_name)` method. This will execute the specified method defined in the controller for the document. It will also trigger any hooks associated with the method. For example, to run the 'validate' method:

```python
 doc.run_method('validate')
```"
You are a Frappe framework expert.,What is the purpose of `doc.queue_action`?,"The `doc.queue_action` method allows you to run a controller method in the background. If the method has an inner function (e.g., `_submit` for `submit`), it will call that inner function instead. This is useful for tasks that don't need to be executed immediately, such as sending emails or processing data in the background. For example:

```python
 doc.queue_action('send_emails', emails=email_list, message='Howdy')
```"
You are a Frappe framework expert.,Are there any methods specific to tree DocTypes?,"Yes, tree DocTypes, which are based on the `NestedSet` class, have specific methods for working with their hierarchical structure:

* `doc.get_children()`: Returns a generator that yields instances of `NestedSet` for each child record. You can use this to traverse the tree structure recursively.
* `doc.get_parent()`: Returns an instance of `NestedSet` for the parent record of the current document."
You are a Frappe framework expert.,I've heard of `doc.db_insert` and `doc.db_update`. Can you explain what they do?,"Both `doc.db_insert` and `doc.db_update` are used for directly inserting or updating a document in the database, bypassing any validations or controller methods.  This should be used with extreme caution.  For example, `doc.db_insert` bypasses all validations and controller methods that might be required to run before and after inserting. Use `doc.insert()` instead when possible.

The same goes for `doc.db_update`, which bypasses validations and controller methods before and after updating. In most cases, you should prefer using `doc.save()`."
You are a Frappe framework expert.,Can you tell me what the `frappe.db.get_list` function does?,"The `frappe.db.get_list` function is a powerful tool for retrieving data from a specific DocType table. It works like an ORM (Object-Relational Mapper) wrapper for a `SELECT` query.  This means you can use it to fetch records in a structured way, without having to write raw SQL queries.  

Here's what it does: 

1. **Retrieves records from a DocType table:** It takes the DocType name as the first argument, and then allows you to filter, sort, and limit the data you retrieve. 

2. **Applies user permissions:**  It ensures that only records accessible by the currently logged-in user are returned. 

3. **Returns document names or a list of dicts:** By default, it returns a list of dictionaries (dicts) representing the records. You can also use the `pluck` keyword argument to retrieve only a specific field from each record as a list. 

You can combine various filters and other arguments to fine-tune the results. For example, you can specify filters to select records based on certain criteria, fields to retrieve only the required data, order the results, and even paginate the results."
You are a Frappe framework expert.,I'm looking at the code for `frappe.db.get_list`. It says it's also aliased to `frappe.get_list`. What does that mean?,"An alias means that `frappe.get_list` is just another name for `frappe.db.get_list`. You can use either one interchangeably.  This is common in programming to provide more convenient or descriptive names for functions.  So, both `frappe.db.get_list('Employee')` and `frappe.get_list('Employee')` would produce the same result."
You are a Frappe framework expert.,"Okay, I understand aliases. Could you show me a simple example of how to use `frappe.db.get_list` to get all tasks with a status of 'Open'?","```python
open_tasks = frappe.db.get_list('Task', filters={'status': 'Open'})
```

This code will retrieve all the records from the 'Task' DocType where the 'status' field is equal to 'Open'. The result will be stored in the `open_tasks` variable as a list of dictionaries. 

Each dictionary will contain information about the task, including the 'name', 'subject', 'description', 'date', and other fields."
You are a Frappe framework expert.,What about `frappe.db.get_all`? How does that differ from `frappe.db.get_list`?,"Both `frappe.db.get_list` and `frappe.db.get_all` are used for retrieving records from DocType tables. The main difference lies in how they handle user permissions: 

* **`frappe.db.get_list`:** Applies user permissions. This means it will only return records that the current user is authorized to access.  This is the more common and secure approach. 

* **`frappe.db.get_all`:** Does *not* apply user permissions. This means it will return *all* records from the DocType table, regardless of whether the user is authorized to access them.  You should use this with caution, as it can expose sensitive data."
You are a Frappe framework expert.,"I see. So, if I want to fetch all tasks, regardless of their status, I should use `frappe.db.get_all`?","That's correct. If you want to retrieve all tasks, even those the user might not normally be allowed to see, use `frappe.db.get_all`. Remember that it's generally safer to stick with `frappe.db.get_list` unless you have a very specific reason to bypass user permissions."
You are a Frappe framework expert.,I'm trying to understand the concept of DocTypes in Frappe. Could you explain what they are and how they relate to database tables?,"In Frappe, DocTypes are like blueprints for your data. They define the structure of your application's data and are the primary building blocks for creating custom applications. When you create a DocType, Frappe automatically creates a corresponding table in your database.  

Think of a DocType as a template for storing information.  For example, a 'Task' DocType would define the fields you need to store for each task, such as 'subject', 'description', 'status', and 'deadline'. Frappe will then generate a 'tabTask' table in your database (the 'tab' prefix is standard in Frappe) with columns representing each of those fields.

This means that every record you create for a DocType (like a specific task) will be stored as a row in the corresponding database table. You can then use functions like `frappe.db.get_list` to fetch records from that table based on your specific needs."
You are a Frappe framework expert.,"So, if I need to retrieve a specific task by its name, should I use `frappe.db.get_list` or `frappe.db.get_value`?","For retrieving a single record based on its name, `frappe.db.get_value` is a more efficient choice.  While `frappe.db.get_list` can be used, it's designed for retrieving lists of records, so it might be slightly slower in this case.  

You can use `frappe.db.get_value` like this: 

```python
task_subject = frappe.db.get_value('Task', 'TASK00002', 'subject')
```

This will fetch the 'subject' field of the 'Task' DocType record with the name 'TASK00002'. You can also use filters instead of the name to retrieve the first matching record."
You are a Frappe framework expert.,Can you give me an example of how to use `frappe.db.set_value` to update a task's subject?,"```python
frappe.db.set_value('Task', 'TASK00002', 'subject', 'New Task Subject')
```

This code will update the 'subject' field of the 'Task' record with the name 'TASK00002' to the new value 'New Task Subject'.  

It's important to note that `frappe.db.set_value` does *not* call ORM triggers like `validate` or `on_update`. This means it bypasses some of the validation and logic that would normally be applied.  Use it cautiously for direct updates, especially if you need to modify hidden fields or have a very specific requirement."
You are a Frappe framework expert.,What about `frappe.db.exists`? How can I use that to check if a task with a specific subject already exists?,"```python
# Check if a task with the subject 'Meeting with Client' exists
task_exists = frappe.db.exists('Task', {'subject': 'Meeting with Client'})
```

The `frappe.db.exists` function takes the DocType name and a dictionary of filters to check for existing records.  In this example, it will return `True` if a task with the subject 'Meeting with Client' is found, and `False` otherwise."
You are a Frappe framework expert.,I'm working with a table called '__internal_cache'. How can I rename it to '__temporary_cache' using Frappe?,"You can use the `frappe.db.rename_table` function to rename tables. Here's how you'd do it: 

```python
frappe.db.rename_table('__internal_cache', '__temporary_cache')
```

Remember that this command will directly execute a SQL query to rename the table.  Make sure you understand the potential impact of this operation before executing it."
You are a Frappe framework expert.,I'm interested in working with the database transaction model in Frappe. Can you explain how it works?,"Frappe's database transaction model is designed to ensure data consistency and integrity. It automatically manages database transactions for you in most cases, so you don't need to write manual commit and rollback statements. 

Here's a simplified overview of how it works: 

1. **Implicit Transactions:** For web requests (`POST` or `PUT`), Frappe starts a transaction at the beginning of the request. If the request completes successfully, the transaction is committed, saving any changes to the database. If there's an error, the transaction is rolled back, undoing any changes. 

2. **Background Jobs and Patches:**  Similar to web requests, transactions are automatically managed for background jobs and patch execution. Changes are committed if the process is successful, and rolled back if there's an error. 

3. **Unit Tests:** Transactions are managed within each test module and at the end of all tests. 

4. **Manual Commit/Rollback:**  While Frappe handles transactions automatically in most scenarios, you can manually commit or rollback transactions if needed using `frappe.db.commit` and `frappe.db.rollback`.  You might need this for complex scenarios or custom logic. 

By managing transactions behind the scenes, Frappe ensures that data changes are applied reliably and consistently. This helps to prevent data corruption and maintain the integrity of your application's data."
You are a Frappe framework expert.,I'm building a custom module that involves writing files to the filesystem. How can I ensure that these files are rolled back if a database transaction fails?,"Frappe provides a mechanism for managing rollback actions beyond the database. You can use the `frappe.db.after_rollback` hook to register a callback function that will be executed if a database transaction is rolled back.  

Here's an example: 

```python
def create_file(self):
    self.write_file()
    # Register the rollback function
    frappe.db.after_rollback.add(self.rollback_file)

def rollback_file(self):
    self.delete_file()
```

In this example: 

1. `create_file` writes a file to the filesystem. 

2. It then uses `frappe.db.after_rollback.add` to register the `rollback_file` function as a callback.  

3. `rollback_file` is responsible for deleting the file if the database transaction is rolled back. 

By using this hook, you can ensure that any changes you make outside the database are consistently rolled back if a transaction fails, maintaining the integrity of your entire system."
You are a Frappe Framework expert.,What is the Jinja API?,"The Jinja API in Frappe Framework provides a set of whitelisted methods you can use within Jinja Templates to interact with your Frappe application. These methods allow you to dynamically generate content, format data, access documents, and more. The Jinja API is a powerful tool for building complex and interactive web pages within the Frappe framework."
You are a Frappe Framework expert.,How can I use `frappe.format` to present a date in a user-friendly way?,"You can use `frappe.format` to convert a raw date stored in your database (e.g., '2019-09-08') into a more user-friendly format.  For example, you can use it to format a date from a document as follows:

```html
<div>{{ frappe.format('2019-09-08', {'fieldtype': 'Date'}) }}</div>
```
This will output `09-08-2019`."
You are a Frappe Framework expert.,Can you show me how to get the current site URL using the Jinja API?,"Sure! You can use the `frappe.get_url()` method to retrieve the current site URL.  Here's an example:

```html
<div>{{ frappe.get_url() }}</div>
```
This will output something like `https://frappe.io`."
You are a Frappe Framework expert.,How do I access a specific document within a Jinja template using the API?,"You can use the `frappe.get_doc` function to retrieve a document by its DocType and name.  For instance, you could retrieve the document named 'TASK00002' from the DocType 'Task' like this:

```html
<div>
  {% set doc = frappe.get_doc('Task', 'TASK00002') %}
  {{ doc.title }} - {{ doc.status }}
</div>
```
This would output the document's title and status (e.g., 'Buy Eggs - Open')."
You are a Frappe Framework expert.,"I want to display a list of all open tasks in a Jinja template, sorted by due date. How can I do that?","You can use the `frappe.get_all` function to fetch a list of documents.  Here's an example of how to get all tasks with a status of 'Open', sorted by due date, and display their title and due date:

```html
<div>
  {% set tasks = frappe.get_all('Task', filters={'status': 'Open'}, fields=['title', 'due_date'], order_by='due_date asc') %}
  {% for task in tasks %}
    <div>
      <h3>{{ task.title }}</h3>
      <p>Due Date: {{ frappe.format_date(task.due_date) }}</p>
    </div>
  {% endfor %}
</div>
```
This will iterate through the tasks and display their information."
You are a Frappe Framework expert.,What is the difference between `frappe.get_all` and `frappe.get_list`?,"Both functions are used for retrieving lists of documents. However, `frappe.get_all` fetches all records of a DocType, while `frappe.get_list` takes into account the user's permissions and only returns records the current user is authorized to access."
You are a Frappe Framework expert.,I want to fetch a single field value from a document. How can I do that using the Jinja API?,"You can use the `frappe.db.get_value` function to retrieve a single field value from a document.  For example, to get the abbreviation of the company 'TennisMart':

```html
<div>
  <span>
    {% set company_abbreviation = frappe.db.get_value('Company', 'TennisMart', 'abbr') %}
    {{ company_abbreviation }}
  </span>
</div>
```
This will output the abbreviation, which might be 'TM'."
You are a Frappe Framework expert.,What is the purpose of `frappe.db.get_single_value`?,"The `frappe.db.get_single_value` function is used to retrieve a field value from a Single DocType. A Single DocType is a special type of DocType that can only have one record. For instance, you might use it to fetch the time zone setting from the 'System Settings' DocType:

```html
<div>
  <span>
    {% set timezone = frappe.db.get_single_value('System Settings', 'time_zone') %}
    {{ timezone }}
  </span>
</div>
```
This might output 'Asia/Kolkata'."
You are a Frappe Framework expert.,Can I dynamically display different payment options based on the user's country?,"Yes, you can. You can use `frappe.get_system_settings` to retrieve a system setting and then use that information to conditionally display different content.  For example, you might show a 'Pay via Razorpay' button if the country is 'India' and a 'Pay via PayPal' button otherwise:

```html
<div>
  {% if frappe.get_system_settings('country') == 'India' %}
    <button>Pay via Razorpay</button>
  {% else %}
    <button>Pay via PayPal</button>
  {% endif %}
</div>
```
This will dynamically show the appropriate payment option based on the system setting."
You are a Frappe Framework expert.,How can I access the metadata of a DocType within a Jinja template?,"You can use the `frappe.get_meta` function to retrieve the metadata of a DocType. This metadata contains information like fields, title fields, image fields, and more. Here's an example:

```html
<div>
  <span>
    {% set meta = frappe.get_meta('Task') %}
    Task has {{ meta.fields | len }} fields.
    {% if meta.get_field('status') %}
      It also has a Status field.
    {% endif %}
  </span>
</div>
```
This will output something like 'Task has 18 fields. It also has a Status field.'"
You are a Frappe Framework expert.,I want to display the full name of a user based on their email address in a Jinja template. How can I do that?,"You can use the `frappe.get_fullname` function to retrieve the full name of a user given their email address.  If no email address is provided, it will return the full name of the currently logged-in user. Here's an example:

```html
<div>
  <span>The fullname of faris@erpnext.com is {{ frappe.get_fullname('faris@erpnext.com') }}</span>
  <span>The current logged in user is {{ frappe.get_fullname() }}</span>
</div>
```
This will output the full names associated with the given email address and the currently logged-in user."
You are a Frappe Framework expert.,Can I render a Jinja template file or string within a Jinja template using the API?,"Yes, you can use the `frappe.render_template` function to render a Jinja template file or string with context.  For instance, you might render a footer template file and a simple template string within your main template:

```html
<div>
  <!-- render a jinja template file -->
  {{ frappe.render_template('templates/includes/footer/footer.html', {}) }}

  <!-- render a jinja template string -->
  <p>{{ frappe.render_template('{{ foo }}', {'foo': 'bar'}) }}</p>
</div>
```
This will output the contents of your footer template and the string 'bar'."
You are a Frappe Framework expert.,How can I translate strings within my Jinja templates?,"You can use the `frappe._(string)` or `_(string)` function to translate strings within your Jinja templates. The Frappe framework will use the current language setting to provide the translated version. For example:

```html
<div>
  <p>{{ _('This string should get translated') }}</p>
</div>
```
If the current language is set to Hindi, this might output '啶囙じ 啶むぞ啶 啶曕ぞ 啶呧え啷佮さ啶距う 啶灌啶ㄠぞ 啶氞ぞ啶灌た啶' (which means 'This string should get translated')."
You are a Frappe Framework expert.,How can I access the current session user within a Jinja template?,You can access the current session user using `frappe.session.user`. This will provide the username of the user who is currently logged in.
You are a Frappe Framework expert.,What about the CSRF token? How can I get it in my template?,You can access the current session's CSRF token using `frappe.session.csrf_token`. This is often used for security purposes in web forms.
You are a Frappe Framework expert.,Can I access query parameters in my Jinja template?,"If your template is being evaluated within a web request, you can access the query parameters through `frappe.form_dict`. This will be a dictionary containing the query parameters from the request. If the template is not in a web request context, `frappe.form_dict` will be `None`."
You are a Frappe Framework expert.,How can I know what language is currently being used by the translation function?,"You can access the current language being used by the translation function through the variable `frappe.lang`. This will be a two-letter lowercase code representing the language, like 'en' for English."
You are a Frappe Framework expert.,Can you explain the request lifecycle in Frappe?,"Sure, the request lifecycle in Frappe is how the framework handles incoming requests from users.  It's a process that starts with receiving a request (like visiting a URL), and ends with delivering a response to the user. Let me break it down."
You are a Frappe Framework expert.,What are the different types of requests Frappe handles?,"Frappe handles a few different types of requests:

1. **API Requests:** These are requests that start with '/api' and are processed by the REST API handler. 
2. **File Downloads:** This includes things like backups, public files, and private files, and the framework handles them differently to deliver the appropriate file.
3. **Web Page Requests:** These are URLs like '/about', '/posts', etc., and are processed by the website router. This is the main focus of this documentation."
You are a Frappe Framework expert.,What happens before the actual routing takes place in a web page request?,"Before the actual routing happens, Frappe performs a few preprocessing steps. These include things like:

* **Initializing the Recorder:** This logs information about the request for debugging and analytics purposes.
* **Initializing the Rate Limiter:** This helps prevent abuse of the system by limiting the number of requests a user can make in a given time period."
You are a Frappe Framework expert.,Explain what the 'Path Resolver' does in the Frappe request lifecycle.,"The Path Resolver is responsible for figuring out where a request should go. Here's what it does:

1. **Redirect Resolution:**  The Path Resolver checks if there are any redirect rules set up for the request path. These rules can come from website redirects defined in the `website_redirects` hook or from website settings. If a redirect is found, the user is automatically sent to the new URL. 
2. **Route Resolution:** If no redirect is found, the Path Resolver tries to determine the final endpoint based on rules from the `website_routing_rules` hook. It also considers dynamic routes set in DocTypes that have the 'has_web_view' property enabled. This means that a DocType like a blog post might have its own URL based on its data. 
3. **Renderer Selection:** Once the final endpoint is identified, the Path Resolver goes through all available Page Renderers to see which one can handle the request. The first renderer that returns 'True' for the 'can_render' check is used to render the page."
You are a Frappe Framework expert.,Can you explain the role of a 'Page Renderer' in Frappe?,"A Page Renderer is responsible for generating the actual response that the user sees. Think of it as the visual part of the request. Here's how it works: 

1. **`can_render`:** When the Path Resolver passes a request to a Page Renderer, the renderer uses the `can_render` method to determine if it's the right one to handle the request. For example, a DocumentPage renderer would check if the request is related to a document template. 
2. **`render`:** If `can_render` returns 'True', the renderer uses the `render` method to generate the HTML or other content needed to respond to the request. The `render` method might fetch data from the database, process templates, and put everything together in a way that the browser understands."
You are a Frappe Framework expert.,What are some of the standard Page Renderers that come with Frappe?,"Frappe comes with several standard Page Renderers to handle common web page types:

* **StaticPage:** This renderer serves static files like PDFs, images, etc., that are stored in the 'www' folder of an app.  
* **TemplatePage:** This renderer finds HTML or markdown files in the 'www' folder of apps and uses them to create pages. 
* **WebformPage:** This renderer renders web forms from the Web Form list, which are like interactive forms on your website. 
* **DocumentPage:** This renderer handles rendering documents stored in the `/templates` folder of DocTypes. You can use this to create custom views of your data. 
* **ListPage:** This renderer creates lists of data from DocTypes. It can be used for displaying data like blog posts, products, etc., in a list format. 
* **PrintPage:** This renderer is used to create printable versions of documents. It uses a standard print format unless you have customized the print format for a specific DocType. 
* **NotFoundPage:** This renderer handles requests for URLs that don't match any other page and displays a '404 Not Found' page. 
* **NotPermittedPage:** This renderer displays a '403 Forbidden' page when a user doesn't have permission to access a page."
You are a Frappe Framework expert.,How can I add my own custom Page Renderer to Frappe?,"You can add your own custom Page Renderer by using the `page_renderer` hook.  Here's how:

1. **Create a Custom Page Renderer Class:**  Create a Python class that inherits from the `BaseRenderer` class. This class should have two methods: 

  * `can_render` method:  Determines if your renderer can handle the current request. 
  * `render` method:  Generates the HTML or other content to respond to the request.

2. **Add the Hook:**  In the `hooks.py` file of your custom app, add the `page_renderer` hook with the path to your custom renderer class. For example: 

  ```python
  page_renderer = 'path.to.your.custom_page_renderer.CustomPage'
  ```

3. **Define the Renderer:**  Here's an example of a custom renderer class:

 ```python
 from frappe.website.utils import build_response
 from frappe.website.page_renderers.base_renderer import BaseRenderer

 class CustomPage(BaseRenderer):
     def can_render(self):
         return True # This could be based on specific conditions
     def render(self):
         response_html = '<div>Custom Response</div>'
         return self.build_response(response_html)
 ```

**Important Notes:**

* Custom page renderers are given priority over standard renderers.  This means that the `can_render` method of a custom renderer will be called before the standard ones.
* You can also extend standard page renderers to override or add to their functionality."
You are a Frappe Framework expert.,I'm a bit confused about the difference between the 'www' folder and the '/templates' folder. Could you clarify?,"You are right to be a bit confused, it can seem a bit tricky. The 'www' folder and the '/templates' folder in Frappe have different purposes.

* **'www' Folder:** This folder is for storing general website files, like HTML templates, CSS, JavaScript, images, and other static assets.  The `TemplatePage` renderer works with files in this folder, so it's a great place to create layouts and reusable parts of your website.

* **'/templates' Folder:** This folder is for storing document templates that are associated with specific DocTypes.  The `DocumentPage` renderer is responsible for using these templates to create customized views of your data. You would put a template file in this folder if you want to have a custom view for a specific type of document, like a blog post or a customer record.

**To illustrate with an example:**

1.  If you wanted to have a basic about page for your website, you would create an 'about.html' file in the 'www' folder and `TemplatePage` would use it to render the about page.
2.  If you had a DocType called 'Blog Post' and you wanted to customize how the 'Blog Post' records are displayed on your website, you would create a 'blog_post.html' file in the `/templates` folder of the 'Blog Post' DocType. `DocumentPage` would then use that template to render the blog post records."
"You are an expert on the Frappe Framework, specifically language resolution.",How does Frappe determine the language for a user's session?,"Frappe uses a specific order of precedence to determine the language for a user's session. It checks the following, in order of priority:

1. **Form Dict's `_lang` parameter**: This parameter has the highest priority and can be used to temporarily override any other settings.
2. **Cookie's `preferred_language`**: This option allows for a more persistent language setting but is only used for guest users. 
3. **Request Header's `Accept-Language`**: This standard method lets clients specify their preferred language. This is also only considered for guest users. 
4. **User document's `language` field**: This field allows individual users to set their preferred language for persistent use across devices.
5. **System Settings' `language` field**: This field sets the default language for the entire site and acts as the fallback language for all sessions."
"You are an expert on the Frappe Framework, specifically language resolution.",I'm building a custom app and need to ensure language settings are applied correctly. How can I utilize the Form Dict's `_lang` parameter for this?,The Form Dict's `_lang` parameter provides the highest level of control over language settings. You can utilize it to temporarily update all translatable components within a specific request. This is particularly useful for managing email templates and print views where you need to ensure the content is presented in the desired language.
"You are an expert on the Frappe Framework, specifically language resolution.",I want to provide users with a more permanent language preference option. How can I implement this using cookies?,"You can implement a persistent, yet temporary language setting using cookies. By setting the `preferred_language` key in cookies, Frappe will use that language for the user's session. This method is used by the website language switcher and is great for allowing users to easily change their language without needing to modify their user profile. Keep in mind, this method is only considered for guest users and will be ignored for logged in users."
"You are an expert on the Frappe Framework, specifically language resolution.",What are the advantages of using the `Accept-Language` header for managing languages in Frappe?,The `Accept-Language` header provides a clean and standardized way to manage languages in Frappe. It allows clients to specify a range of acceptable languages in order of preference. Frappe will then try to match these preferences with available languages. This method is also considered only for guest users and is ignored for logged in users. You can find more information about the `Accept-Language` header in the [Mozilla Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Accept-Language).
"You are an expert on the Frappe Framework, specifically language resolution.",How does Frappe handle language settings for logged-in users? What about their persistence?,"For logged-in users, Frappe uses the `language` field in the User document to set the session language. This field allows users to select their preferred language, and this setting is persisted across different devices and clients. So, if a user sets their language to 'Russian' on a 'French' site, they will automatically see the site translated to Russian when they log in. This provides a consistent language experience for users regardless of where they access the Frappe application."
"You are an expert on the Frappe Framework, specifically language resolution.",I'm working on a site-wide language setting. Which field in Frappe controls this?,"The `language` field in the System Settings controls the default language for the entire Frappe site. This setting has the lowest priority and acts as a fallback language for all sessions. If none of the other language settings are set, Frappe will use the language defined in the System Settings."
You are a Frappe Framework expert.,What are utility functions in Frappe Framework?,"Utility functions in Frappe Framework are helpful methods for common tasks like date and time management, currency formatting, PDF generation, and more. They're designed to make development easier by providing pre-built solutions for frequently used operations."

"You are an expert on the Frappe Framework, specifically its search functionality.",I'm trying to understand how to customize the search behavior for my specific application. Can you explain how to extend the `FullTextSearch` class?,"Absolutely! To tailor search for your needs, you can extend the `FullTextSearch` class. Each `FullTextSearch` instance has its own schema, which defines the structure of data being indexed. You can create a new implementation with a customized schema to suit your application's requirements. For example, the `WebsiteSearch` class is specifically designed to index web pages and offer search functionality for your website."
"You are an expert on the Frappe Framework, specifically its search functionality.","Okay, I'm interested in creating a search implementation for blog posts.  Can you give me an example of how I might structure the code for this?","Let's break it down. Here's an example of a `BlogWrapper` class that extends `FullTextSearch` and handles indexing and searching for blog posts within the Frappe Framework:

```python
class BlogWrapper(FullTextSearch):
    # Default Schema
    # def get_schema(self):
    #   return Schema(name=ID(stored=True), content=TEXT(stored=True))

    # def get_id(self):
    #   return ""name""

    def get_items_to_index(self):
        docs = []
        for blog_name in get_all_blogs():
            docs.append(get_document_to_index(blog_name))
        return docs

    def get_document_to_index(self, name):
        blog = frappe.get_doc(""Blog Post"", name)
        return frappe._dict(name=name, content=blog.content)

    def parse_result(self, result):
        return result[""name""]
```

This example demonstrates how you can define your schema, retrieve blog posts to index, and format search results for your blog application within the Frappe Framework."
"You are an expert on the Frappe Framework, specifically its search functionality.","I see that `get_items_to_index`, `get_document_to_index`, and `parse_result` are mentioned in the example. What are these methods responsible for?","Those are key methods in your search class. Here's a breakdown:

* `get_items_to_index`: This method defines how to retrieve the documents you want to index. In the example, it loops through all blog posts and returns a list of items to be indexed.

* `get_document_to_index`:  This method takes a single item from `get_items_to_index` and transforms it into a dictionary that conforms to your defined schema. In the example, it fetches the blog post content and creates a dictionary with the 'name' and 'content' fields.

* `parse_result`: This method receives search results and formats them into a user-friendly display. In this case, it simply returns the name of the blog post from the search result."

You are a Frappe framework expert.,What is Frappe framework?,"Frappe, pronounced fra-pay, is a full stack, batteries-included, web framework written in Python and Javascript with MariaDB as the database. It is the framework which powers ERPNext, is pretty generic and can be used to build database driven apps. You can access Frappe framework's documentation here: https://frappeframework.com/docs/user/en/api/rest"
You are a Frappe framework expert.,What is a DocType in Frappe?,"A DocType is the core building block of any application based on the Frappe Framework.  It defines the structure and behaviour of a data record (or document) within your application.  Think of it like a blueprint for a table in a relational database, but with additional features for managing user interfaces and business logic."
You are a Frappe framework expert.,How do I authenticate to the Frappe REST API?,"You have a couple of options for authenticating with the Frappe REST API: 

1. **Token-based authentication:** This involves generating an API key and secret for a user. You then concatenate the key and secret with a colon (`:`) and pass this string in the `Authorization` header of your requests using the format `token api_key:api_secret`.  
2. **Password-based authentication:** This utilizes cookies and session data. You can use this method if the library you're using to make REST calls handles session data. If not, you should opt for token-based authentication.
3. **Access Token:**  This method uses OAuth, where you obtain an `access_token` and include it in the `Authorization` header of your requests using the format `Bearer access_token`."
You are a Frappe framework expert.,How do I get a list of all ToDo documents using the Frappe REST API?,"To fetch a list of ToDo documents, you would send a GET request to the endpoint `/api/resource/ToDo`. By default, it will return the names of the first 20 ToDo records. The results are found within the `data` field of the response payload. 

You can further customize the request by adding query parameters: 
- `fields`: Specify the specific fields you want to retrieve, provided as a JSON array like `fields=['description', 'name']`. 
- `filters`: Apply filters to narrow down the results. Each filter is defined as an array of `[field, operator, value]` such as `filters=[['status', '=', 'Open'], ['priority', '>', 'Medium']]`. 
- `order_by`: Sort the results. Use the format `fieldname asc` or `fieldname desc`, URL encoding spaces. For example: `order_by=title%20desc` 
- `limit_start`: Set the starting index for pagination. 
- `limit_page_length`:  Define the number of records to retrieve per page.  You can also use the alias `limit` for `limit_page_length` in Version 13. 
- `as_dict=False`:  Retrieve the data as `List[List]` instead of the default `List[dict]`. 
- `debug=True`:  Include the executed query and execution time in the `exc` field of the response."
You are a Frappe framework expert.,How do I create a new ToDo document using the Frappe REST API?,"You can create a new ToDo document by sending a POST request to the endpoint `/api/resource/ToDo`. Ensure you set the `Accept` and `Content-Type` headers to `application/json` in your request. In the request body, provide the new ToDo document as a JSON object. For example:

```json
{""description"": ""New ToDo""}
```

The response will include the newly created ToDo document with its generated name and other details."
You are a Frappe framework expert.,How do I update an existing ToDo document?,"To update an existing ToDo document, you'll send a PUT request to `/api/resource/ToDo/:name` (replace `:name` with the name of the ToDo document you want to update).  You don't need to send the entire document, only the fields you want to modify. For instance:

```json
{""description"": ""Updated description""}
```

The response will contain the updated ToDo document with the modified fields."
You are a Frappe framework expert.,How do I delete a ToDo document?,You can delete a ToDo document by sending a DELETE request to `/api/resource/ToDo/:name` (replace `:name` with the name of the ToDo document you wish to delete). The response will usually be a simple JSON object with a message like `{"message": "ok"}`.
You are a Frappe framework expert.,What are remote method calls in Frappe?,"Remote method calls in Frappe allow you to execute arbitrary Python methods within your application via the REST API. To make a method accessible via REST, you need to mark it as _whitelisted_.

To call a whitelisted method, you send a request to the endpoint `/api/method/<module_path>`. For instance, to call the method `frappe.auth.get_logged_user`, you would send a request to `/api/method/frappe.auth.get_logged_user`.

- If the method returns values, use a GET request. 
- If the method modifies the database, use a POST request.  Frappe will automatically call `frappe.db.commit()` to save changes after a successful POST request. 
- A successful response will include a JSON object with a `message` key. 
- An error response will contain a JSON object with an `exc` key (stack trace) and `exc_type` key (exception type). 
- The method's return value is converted to JSON and sent in the response."
You are an expert on the Frappe Framework and its FullTextSearch API.,I'm looking for information on the FullTextSearch API in the Frappe Framework. Can you tell me what it is and what it does?,"The FullTextSearch API in the Frappe Framework provides a way to search through your data using a powerful full-text search engine. It's built on top of the Whoosh library, a fast and efficient Python library for indexing and searching text. You can use this API to implement search functionality within your Frappe applications."
You are an expert on the Frappe Framework and its FullTextSearch API.,I see the API has a method called `update_index_by_name`. What does this method do?,"The `update_index_by_name` method updates the search index for a specific document. It retrieves the document using its name, updates the index with the document's content, and ensures that the search results reflect the latest changes. This method is useful when you want to update the index for a single document without rebuilding the entire index."
You are an expert on the Frappe Framework and its FullTextSearch API.,What are the security considerations when using `update_index_by_name`?,The `update_index_by_name` method changes the current user context and should only be used by administrators or executed as a background job. This is because modifying the search index can affect the search results for all users. It's crucial to ensure that only authorized individuals have access to this method to maintain data integrity and prevent malicious actions.
You are an expert on the Frappe Framework and its FullTextSearch API.,Can you explain the `search` method in more detail?,"The `search` method allows you to search for text within your indexed documents. You can specify the text you're looking for, and optionally, you can limit the search scope and the number of results returned. It returns a list of dictionaries containing the relevant documents and their information, making it easy to integrate with your application's user interface."
You are an expert on the Frappe Framework and its FullTextSearch API.,I'm working on a Frappe application that needs to implement search. Can you provide an example of how to use the `search` method?,"```python
from frappe.core.doctype.full_text_search.full_text_search import FullTextSearch

# Create a FullTextSearch instance
fts = FullTextSearch()

# Search for documents containing the text 'invoice'
search_results = fts.search(text='invoice', limit=10)

# Print the search results
for result in search_results:
    print(result)
```
This code demonstrates how to perform a basic search using the `search` method. You can adjust the `text`, `scope`, and `limit` parameters according to your needs to fine-tune the search results."
You are an expert on the Frappe Framework and its FullTextSearch API.,I noticed the `build_index` method. When should I use this?,"The `build_index` method is used to create a fresh index for all parsed documents. You should use this method when you want to rebuild the index from scratch. This might be necessary after significant changes to your data, such as adding new documents, modifying existing documents, or changing the indexing configuration. It ensures that the search index is up-to-date and accurate."
You are an expert on the Frappe Framework and its FullTextSearch API.,Where can I find more information about the FullTextSearch API and how to use it in my Frappe application?,"You can find detailed documentation and examples of how to use the FullTextSearch API on the Frappe Framework website at [https://frappeframework.com/docs/user/en/api/full-text-search](https://frappeframework.com/docs/user/en/api/full-text-search).

It works within the request/response cycle of a web application, showing the message to the user logged in to the Frappe Desk who initiated the request. This function is very useful for providing feedback to users, indicating errors or successes, and for prompting them with information."
You are an expert on the Frappe Framework's Dialog API.,How can I use `frappe.msgprint` to display a table of data?,"You can use the `as_table` argument in `frappe.msgprint`. If you pass a list of lists as the `msg` argument, and set `as_table` to `True`, Frappe will render the data as an HTML table within the displayed message."
You are an expert on the Frappe Framework's Dialog API.,What are the benefits of using `frappe.throw` over `frappe.msgprint`?,"While `frappe.msgprint` simply displays a message, `frappe.throw` combines displaying a message with raising an exception. This allows you to handle errors in your code more effectively. When `frappe.throw` is called, it raises a `ValidationError` exception by default, which can be caught and handled by your application logic. This helps maintain code consistency and provides a robust mechanism for error handling."
You are an expert on the Frappe Framework's Dialog API.,Can I use `frappe.msgprint` to display a list of items?,"Yes, you can use the `as_list` argument to display a list of items. If you pass a list as the `msg` argument and set `as_list` to `True`, Frappe will render the items as an unordered list within the message."
You are an expert on the Frappe Framework's Dialog API.,I want to use `frappe.msgprint` to display an error message and offer the user an option to retry an action. How can I do that?,"You can achieve this using the `primary_action` argument in `frappe.msgprint`. This allows you to bind a server-side or client-side action to the message.  Here's how you can set up a retry option:

1. **Define a server-side method** that will retry the action. Let's assume you have a method called `retry_action` in your script.
2. **In your `frappe.msgprint` call,** set `primary_action` to a dictionary with the following structure:

```python
frappe.msgprint(
    msg='Error occurred. Do you want to retry?',
    title='Error',
    primary_action = {
        'label': 'Retry',
        'server_action': 'your_script.retry_action'
    }
)
```

This will display the message and a 'Retry' button. When the user clicks 'Retry', the `retry_action` method will be executed on the server side."
You are an expert on the Frappe Framework's Dialog API.,What are the differences between the 'server_action' and 'client_action' options in the `primary_action` dictionary?,"'server_action' and 'client_action' in the `primary_action` dictionary allow you to bind actions to the displayed message. 

- **'server_action'** executes a method on the server side of your application. You need to provide the full dotted path to the method you want to execute, for example, 'your_script.your_server_method'.

- **'client_action'** executes a Javascript function on the client side of your application. You need to provide the dotted path to the globally available Javascript function, for example, 'your_script.your_client_method'.

Choose the appropriate option based on where you need the action to be executed."
You are an expert on the Frappe Framework's Dialog API.,How can I learn more about the Frappe Framework and its documentation?,"The official documentation for the Frappe Framework is a great resource for learning more about the framework, its features, and its API.

The documentation covers a wide range of topics, including installation, development, customization, and the usage of various features and APIs. You can also find helpful community forums and discussions on the Frappe website and other online platforms."
You are a Frappe Framework expert.,What is the purpose of the Frappe Query Builder?,"The Frappe Query Builder, powered by PyPika, simplifies database interactions by providing a Pythonic API to construct SQL queries. It aims to make querying data easier and more readable while retaining the flexibility of writing raw SQL."
You are a Frappe Framework expert.,How do I use the `frappe.qb.from_` function?,"The `frappe.qb.from_` function is used to start a 'from' clause in your SQL query. It takes a DocType as an argument, representing the table you want to select data from. For instance, `frappe.qb.from_('Customer')` will specify that you're querying the 'tabCustomer' table."
You are a Frappe Framework expert.,Can you give me an example of how to use the `frappe.qb.DocType` function?,"Absolutely! Let's say you want to work with the 'Web Page View' DocType. You would use the `frappe.qb.DocType` function like this:

```python
from frappe.query_builder import DocType

WebPageView = DocType(""Web Page View"")
```

Now you can use the `WebPageView` variable to reference the 'Web Page View' DocType in your query."
You are a Frappe Framework expert.,How does the Frappe Query Builder handle parameterization and prevent SQL injection?,"Security is paramount. All queries built using `frappe.qb` are parameterized by default. This means that input fields, values, and functions are treated as named parameters and sent to the database as a dictionary, ensuring that user-provided data is properly sanitized and prevents SQL injection vulnerabilities."
You are a Frappe Framework expert.,What are some examples of the standard functions available in `frappe.query_builder.functions`?,"The `frappe.query_builder.functions` module offers a range of helpful functions for building complex queries. Some common examples include:

* `Count()`: Used for counting the number of rows in a table or a group.
* `Sum()`: Calculates the sum of values in a column.
* `Avg()`: Finds the average value of a column.
* `Min()`: Retrieves the minimum value from a column.
* `Max()`: Retrieves the maximum value from a column."
You are a Frappe Framework expert.,How do I join tables in a query using Frappe's Query Builder?,"The Frappe Query Builder utilizes PyPika for joins, allowing you to connect data from different DocTypes. Here's a basic example using the `inner_join` function:

```python
from frappe.query_builder import DocType

HasRole = DocType('Has Role')
CustomRole = DocType('Custom Role')

query = (frappe.qb.from_(HasRole)
        .inner_join(CustomRole)
        .on(CustomRole.name == HasRole.parent)
        .select(CustomRole.page, HasRole.parent, HasRole.role))
```

This query joins the 'Has Role' and 'Custom Role' DocTypes on a common column 'parent' and selects specific fields. You can refer to the [Pypika documentation](https://pypika.readthedocs.io/en/latest/2_tutorial.html#joining-tables-and-subqueries) for more detailed guidance on joins."
You are a Frappe Framework expert.,What is the purpose of the `run` method in the Query Builder?,"The `run` method is your primary tool for executing your built queries. It takes any optional keyword arguments (`kwargs`) that you might need to pass to the underlying `frappe.db.sql` function. This allows you to fine-tune the execution behavior, such as enabling debugging (`debug=True`) or requesting the result in a dictionary format (`as_dict=True`). In essence, it's the bridge between your query and the database."
You are a Frappe Framework expert.,Where can I learn more about custom functions in the Query Builder?,"While `frappe.query_builder.functions` includes standard SQL functions, you can also craft your own custom functions using PyPika's `CustomFunction` class. The Frappe Query Builder documentation provides a basic example of a DateDiff function. For more advanced customization, it's recommended to delve into the PyPika documentation for a deeper understanding of function creation."
You are a Frappe Framework expert.,What are the main components of the Frappe Developer API?,"The Frappe Developer API is divided into two main sections: Python and Javascript. The Python API is primarily used for server-side logic and accessing database functionality. It offers a wide range of tools, including document management, database operations, Jinja templating, and utilities. The Javascript API, on the other hand, focuses on client-side interactions, providing methods for manipulating forms, controls, pages, trees, and server communication through AJAX calls. It also includes features for dialogs, charts, and scanners."
You are a Frappe Framework expert.,Can you tell me more about the 'Document' API in Python?,"The 'Document' API in Python provides the core functionality for interacting with data in Frappe. It allows you to create, read, update, and delete documents, which are essentially data entries in your database. You can use methods like `frappe.get_doc()` to retrieve a document, `frappe.new_doc()` to create a new one, and `frappe.db.commit()` to save changes. You can also access and manipulate individual fields of a document, making it very powerful for data management within your Frappe application."
You are a Frappe Framework expert.,I'm interested in using the Frappe API to build a custom form. What Javascript APIs are relevant for this task?,"For building a custom form in Frappe, you'll primarily be working with the 'Form' and 'Controls' APIs in Javascript. The 'Form' API provides methods for manipulating forms on the client-side, including actions like `frappe.ui.form.on()` to handle events and `frappe.ui.form.trigger()` to execute custom functions. The 'Controls' API gives you access to individual form controls like input fields, dropdown menus, and buttons. You can use it to set values, validate input, and trigger actions based on user interactions."
You are a Frappe Framework expert.,I see that the Developer API documentation also mentions a 'REST API'. How does it relate to the Python and Javascript APIs?,"The 'REST API' in Frappe is a separate layer that allows you to interact with your Frappe application from external systems using standard HTTP requests. It provides a consistent way to access and manipulate data, regardless of the programming language you're using.  While the Python and Javascript APIs are primarily designed for development within the Frappe framework, the REST API opens up the possibility of integrating your application with other tools and services."
You are a Frappe Framework expert.,"Where can I find more detailed information about these APIs, such as examples and use cases?","The documentation for the Frappe Developer API is available at [https://frappeframework.com/docs/user/en/api](https://frappeframework.com/docs/user/en/api).  Each API section has detailed explanations, code examples, and illustrative use cases to help you understand how to implement them effectively in your applications. You can also find many resources and community forums online where developers share their knowledge and experiences using the Frappe API."
You are a Frappe Framework expert.,Can you explain what Form Scripts are in Frappe?,"Form Scripts in Frappe allow you to add client-side logic to your forms. They provide a way to enhance functionality by enabling automated actions, adding validation rules, or implementing contextual behaviors within your forms."
You are a Frappe Framework expert.,Where are Standard Form Scripts typically written?,"Standard Form Scripts are written in a file named `{doctype}.js` which is automatically created when you define a new DocType. For instance, the form script for the `ToDo` DocType would be in `frappe/desk/doctype/todo/todo.js`."
You are a Frappe Framework expert.,How do I add a custom button to a ToDo form that opens the referenced document?,"You can use the `frm.add_custom_button()` method within the `refresh` event of your `todo.js` script. The code would look like this:

```javascript
frappe.ui.form.on('ToDo', {
  refresh(frm) {
    if (frm.doc.reference_type && frm.doc.reference_name) {
      frm.add_custom_button(__(frm.doc.reference_name), () => {
        frappe.set_route(""Form"", frm.doc.reference_type, frm.doc.reference_name);
      });
    }
  }
});
```

This code checks if the `reference_type` and `reference_name` fields are filled in the ToDo document. If they are, it adds a custom button with the label of the referenced document name. Clicking the button will then open the referenced document in a new form."
You are a Frappe Framework expert.,Can you explain the difference between Standard Form Scripts and Custom Form Scripts?,"Standard Form Scripts are written directly in the `{doctype}.js` file associated with each DocType. They are designed to be specific to the DocType and its functionality. Custom Form Scripts, on the other hand, are created through the **Client Script** doctype in Frappe. They allow for more flexible, site-specific logic that can be applied across different DocTypes or even across multiple Frappe instances. While Standard Form Scripts are good for core functionality tied to a DocType, Custom Form Scripts are better for more complex or customized scenarios."
You are a Frappe Framework expert.,What are some common Form Events that can be used in Form Scripts?,"Here are some common Form Events that you can utilize in your Form Scripts:

* **`setup`:** Triggered once when the form is created for the first time. This is a good place to set up initial conditions or validations.
* **`before_load`:** Triggered before the form is about to load. You can use this event to modify the data being loaded.
* **`onload`:** Triggered when the form is loaded and is about to render. Use this to perform actions after the form data has been fetched from the server.
* **`refresh`:** Triggered after the form is fully loaded and rendered.  It's useful for updating the form UI or dynamically adding elements.
* **`validate`:** Triggered before the `before_save` event. This is where you can validate the form data before saving.
* **`before_save`:** Triggered just before the form is saved. Use this to make any final adjustments or perform further validation before saving the data to the database.
* **`after_save`:** Triggered after the form is successfully saved.
* **`before_submit`:** Triggered before the form is submitted.
* **`on_submit`:** Triggered after the form is submitted.
* **`before_cancel`:** Triggered before the form is cancelled.
* **`after_cancel`:** Triggered after the form is cancelled.
* **`timeline_refresh`:** Triggered after the form timeline is rendered.
* **`{fieldname}_on_form_rendered`:** Triggered when a row is opened as a form in a Table field. Useful for customizing the appearance of child tables.
* **`{fieldname}`:** Triggered when the value of a field is changed.  You can use this to perform actions like updating other fields or triggering validation.
* **`get_email_recipient_filters`:** Triggered by the email dialog to fetch default filters for email recipients.
* **`get_email_recipients`:** Triggered by the email dialog to fetch default email recipients."
You are a Frappe Framework expert.,How do I call a server-side controller method from within a Form Script?,"You can use the `frm.call()` method to call a server-side controller method from your Form Script. Remember, the server-side method needs to be whitelisted using the `@frappe.whitelist` decorator. For example:

```python
# Server-side controller method
class ToDo(Document):
  @frappe.whitelist()
  def get_linked_doc(self, throw_if_missing=False):
    if not frappe.db.exists(self.reference_type, self.reference_name):
      if throw_if_missing:
        frappe.throw('Linked document not found')
    return frappe.get_doc(self.reference_type, self.reference_name)

# Form Script
frappe.ui.form.on('ToDo', {
  refresh(frm) {
    frm.call('get_linked_doc', { throw_if_missing: true })
      .then(r => {
        if (r.message) {
          let linked_doc = r.message;
          // Do something with linked_doc
        }
      })
  }
});
```

This code calls the `get_linked_doc` server-side method from the `refresh` event of the `ToDo` form script. The method returns the referenced document, which you can then use within your client-side logic."
You are a Frappe Framework expert. You are familiar with the `frappe.ui.form.make_control` function and the various control types it supports.,Can you explain what the `frappe.ui.form.make_control` function does?,"The `frappe.ui.form.make_control` function is a core component of the Frappe Framework's form system. It takes a `parent` container and a `df` (docfield) object as input, and uses the information in `df` to create and append the corresponding Frappe control to the `parent` container.  This allows you to dynamically generate form elements based on the data you provide in the `df` object."
You are a Frappe Framework expert. You are familiar with the `frappe.ui.form.make_control` function and the various control types it supports.,What kind of controls can I create using the `frappe.ui.form.make_control` function?,"Frappe provides a wide range of control types that you can use to build your forms. Here are a few examples:

* **Basic Controls:** Attach, Attach Image, Autocomplete, Barcode, Check, Code, Color, Currency, Data, Date, Date Range, Datetime, Dynamic Link, Float, Geolocation, HTML Editor, Int, Link, Markdown Editor, MultiCheck, MultiSelect, Password, Rating, Select, Signature, Text Editor, Time, Button, Icon

You can find a detailed description of each control type and its associated properties in the Frappe Framework documentation: [https://frappeframework.com/docs/user/en/api/controls](https://frappeframework.com/docs/user/en/api/controls)."
You are a Frappe Framework expert. You are familiar with the `frappe.ui.form.make_control` function and the various control types it supports.,Could you give me an example of how to create a 'Date' control using `frappe.ui.form.make_control`?,"```javascript
frappe.ui.form.make_control({
  parent: $wrapper.find('.my-control'),
  df: {
    label: 'Due Date',
    fieldname: 'due_date',
    fieldtype: 'Date'
  },
  render_input: true
})
```

In this example, we are creating a 'Date' control with the label 'Due Date', fieldname 'due_date' and placing it within the element with the class 'my-control'. The `render_input: true` option ensures that the input field for the date is rendered."
You are a Frappe Framework expert. You are familiar with the `frappe.ui.form.make_control` function and the various control types it supports.,"How can I customize the appearance of a control, for example, changing the size of a button?","You can customize the appearance of controls by using additional properties within the `df` object. For example, to change the size of a button, you can add the `btn_size` property with values like 'xs', 'sm', or 'lg'.

```javascript
frappe.ui.form.make_control({
  parent: $wrapper.find('.my-control'),
  df: {
    label: 'Fetch',
    fieldname: 'fetch',
    fieldtype: 'Button',
    btn_size: 'xs'
  },
  render_input: true
})
```

This will create a button with the label 'Fetch' and the smallest size (xs)."
You are a Frappe Framework expert. You are familiar with the `frappe.ui.form.make_control` function and the various control types it supports.,I want to create a custom formatter for a text field. How can I do that?,"You can add custom formatters for text-based control types like 'Data', 'Select', and 'Text' by modifying the `docfield` object within the `frappe.meta.docfield_map` dictionary. This allows you to define a function that will be applied to the value before it's displayed in the control.

For example, to display a special marker for 'Section Break' values in a text field, you could do this:

```javascript
frappe.meta.docfield_map['DocField'].fieldtype.formatter = (value) => {
  if (value === 'Section Break') return '馃數 Section Break';
  else return value;
}
```

This will replace any value equal to 'Section Break' with the formatted string '馃數 Section Break' when displayed."
You are a Frappe Framework expert.,What is the List View in Frappe?,"The List View in Frappe is a powerful way to display and manage data for various DocTypes in your application. It's essentially a table-like representation of your data with features like filtering, sorting, paging, and more. It's available for all DocTypes except Child Tables and Single DocTypes."
You are a Frappe Framework expert.,"Can I customize the List View in Frappe? If yes, how?","Yes, you can customize the List View in Frappe. You have two main options:

1. **Standard List JS:** Create a `{doctype}_list.js` file in the respective DocType's directory. This file allows you to customize various aspects of the List View, such as:

    - Adding fields to fetch
    - Setting default filters
    - Hiding columns and filter fields
    - Adding custom indicators and actions
    - Formatting field values

2. **Custom List JS:** Create a Client Script in your Frappe application. This approach is ideal for customizations specific to your site and allows you to modify the List View's behavior using JavaScript code. You can access and modify the List View components using the Frappe API."
You are a Frappe Framework expert.,Can you give me an example of how to customize the List View for the Note DocType using Standard List JS?,"Sure! Here's an example of customizing the List View for the Note DocType using Standard List JS. You'd create a file named `note_list.js` in the Note DocType's directory and add the following code:

```javascript
frappe.listview_settings['Note'] = {
  // add fields to fetch
  add_fields: ['title', 'public'],
  // set default filters
  filters: [
    ['public', '=', 1]
  ],
  hide_name_column: true, // hide the last column which shows the `name`
  hide_name_filter: true, // hide the default filter field for the name column
  onload(listview) {
    // triggers once before the list is loaded
  },
  before_render() {
    // triggers before every render of list records
  },

  // set this to true to apply indicator function on draft documents too
  has_indicator_for_draft: false,

  get_indicator(doc) {
    // customize indicator color
    if (doc.public) {
      return [__('Public'), 'green', 'public,=,Yes'];
    } else {
      return [__('Private'), 'darkgrey', 'public,=,No'];
    }
  },
  primary_action() {
    // triggers when the primary action is clicked
  },
  get_form_link(doc) {
    // override the form route for this doc
  },
  // add a custom button for each row
  button: {
    show(doc) {
      return doc.reference_name;
    },
    get_label() {
      return 'View';
    },
    get_description(doc) {
      return __('View {0}', [`${doc.reference_type} ${doc.reference_name}`]);
    },
    action(doc) {
      frappe.set_route('Form', doc.reference_type, doc.reference_name);
    }
  },
  // format how a field value is shown
  formatters: {
    title(val) {
      return val.bold();
    },
    public(val) {
      return val ? 'Yes' : 'No';
    }
  }
};
```

This code will customize the List View for the Note DocType by:

- Fetching the 'title' and 'public' fields
- Filtering by 'public = 1' (showing only public notes)
- Hiding the 'name' column and its filter
- Adding an indicator based on the 'public' field (green for public, darkgray for private)
- Adding a 'View' button that opens the form of the associated reference
- Bolding the 'title' field and showing 'Yes' or 'No' for the 'public' field"

You are a Frappe Framework expert.,I want to understand how the Tree View works in Frappe. Can you explain?,"The Tree View in Frappe is a visual representation of hierarchical data, often used to display relationships between different documents. It's generated for any DocType that has the 'Is Tree' option enabled. You can see an example in the documentation at [https://frappeframework.com/docs/user/en/api/tree](https://frappeframework.com/docs/user/en/api/tree)."
You are a Frappe Framework expert.,"So, if I want to customize the Tree View for a specific DocType, how would I go about it?","You'll need to create a JavaScript file named `{doctype}_tree.js` within the DocType's directory. For example, if you want to customize the Tree View for the 'Account' DocType, you'd create a file called `account_tree.js`.  This file allows you to define various options to tailor the Tree View to your needs."
You are a Frappe Framework expert.,"Okay, that makes sense. What are some of the customization options I can use in this JavaScript file?","There are many options available! You can set the breadcrumb, the title of the Tree View, add filters, define how the tree nodes are fetched and added, customize the fields used for new nodes, and much more. The documentation provides a detailed list of these options, along with code examples to guide you."
You are a Frappe Framework expert.,I'm especially interested in adding custom buttons to the Tree View. Is that possible?,"Absolutely! You can add custom buttons to the Tree View using the `menu_items` and `toolbar` options within your `{doctype}_tree.js` file.  `menu_items` allows you to add buttons to the three-dot menu, while `toolbar` lets you add buttons that appear next to each node in the Tree View.  You can define the label, action, conditions, and even the button class to customize the appearance."
You are a Frappe Framework expert.,That sounds great! Can you show me an example of how I might add a button to the three-dot menu to create a new 'Company' record?,"Certainly! You would add the following code within the `menu_items` section of your `account_tree.js` file:

```javascript
menu_items: [
  {
    label: 'New Company',
    action: function() { frappe.new_doc('Company', true) },
    condition: 'frappe.boot.user.can_create.indexOf('Company') !== -1'
  }
]
```

This code will add a button labeled 'New Company' to the three-dot menu. When clicked, it will open a new form for creating a 'Company' record.  The `condition` ensures the button is only visible if the user has permission to create 'Company' records."
You are a Frappe Framework expert.,How can I get the current route in Frappe using JavaScript?,"You can use the `frappe.get_route()` function. It returns the current route as an array. For example, if you are on the 'List' DocType, 'Task' view, and 'List' sub-view, `frappe.get_route()` will return `['List', 'Task', 'List']`."
You are a Frappe Framework expert.,I want to change the current route to the 'Gantt' view of the 'Task' DocType. How do I do that?,"You can use `frappe.set_route()`. You can pass the route in parts like `frappe.set_route('List', 'Task', 'Gantt')` or as an array `frappe.set_route(['List', 'Task', 'Gantt'])`. You can also pass a string like `frappe.set_route('List/Event/Calendar')` to change the route."
You are a Frappe Framework expert.,What is the `frappe.format()` function used for?,"The `frappe.format()` function is used to format a raw value into a user-presentable format.

You are a Frappe Framework expert.,Can you explain the purpose of `frappe.provide()`?,"`frappe.provide()` is used to create a namespace attached to the window object if it doesn't exist. It helps organize your code and avoid potential naming conflicts. For example, `frappe.provide('frappe.ui.form')` creates a nested object `frappe.ui.form` within the window object."
You are a Frappe Framework expert.,How do I load a JavaScript or CSS asset asynchronously in Frappe?,"You can use `frappe.require(asset_path, callback)` to load an asset asynchronously. It is useful for libraries that are not used often. You can provide a single asset path or an array of asset paths. The callback function will be executed once the assets are loaded. For example: `frappe.require('/assets/frappe/chat.js', () => { /* chat.js is loaded */ })`."

You are a Frappe framework expert.,I want to create a custom dialog. What is the best way to do this in Frappe?,"You can use the `frappe.ui.Dialog` class to create a custom dialog. It allows you to define the title, fields, and actions of your dialog. Here is an example: 

```javascript
let d = new frappe.ui.Dialog({
  title: 'Enter details',
  fields: [
    {
      label: 'First Name',
      fieldname: 'first_name',

      label: 'Age',
      fieldname: 'age',
      fieldtype: 'Int'
    }
  ],
  primary_action_label: 'Submit',
  primary_action(values) {
    console.log(values);
    d.hide();
  }
});

d.show();
```

This code will create a dialog with the title 'Enter details' and three fields: 'First Name', 'Last Name', and 'Age'. The dialog will have a 'Submit' button that will be triggered when the user clicks it. The `primary_action` function will then log the values entered by the user to the console and hide the dialog."
You are a Frappe framework expert.,Can you tell me more about the `frappe.msgprint` function?,"The `frappe.msgprint` function is used to display a message in a modal dialog. You can pass a string as the message, or you can pass an object with the following properties:

* `title`: The title of the modal dialog.
* `message`: The message to be displayed in the modal dialog.
* `indicator`: The indicator to be shown in the modal dialog (e.g., 'green', 'red', 'blue').

Here are some examples of how to use `frappe.msgprint`:

```javascript
// Only message
frappe.msgprint(__('Document updated successfully'));

// With options
frappe.msgprint({
  title: __('Notification'),
  indicator: 'green',
  message: __('Document updated successfully')
});
```"
You are a Frappe framework expert.,How can I use `frappe.msgprint` to show a confirmation dialog?,"You can bind a primary action to a `frappe.msgprint` dialog to show a confirmation dialog.  The primary action can contain either a `server_action` or a `client_action` which are dotted paths to the respective methods that will execute on clicking the primary button. Here's an example:

```javascript
frappe.msgprint({
  title: __('Notification'),
  message: __('Are you sure you want to proceed?'),
  primary_action: {
    'label': 'Proceed',
    // either one of the actions can be passed
    'server_action': 'dotted.path.to.method',
    'client_action': 'dotted_path.to_method',
    'args': args
  }
});
```

This code will create a confirmation dialog with the message 'Are you sure you want to proceed?' and a 'Proceed' button. Clicking the 'Proceed' button will execute the specified `server_action` or `client_action`."
You are a Frappe framework expert.,What is the purpose of the `frappe.throw` function?,"The `frappe.throw` function is used to display an error message in a modal dialog and throw an exception. You can pass the error message as an argument to the function. Here's an example:

```javascript
frappe.throw(__('This is an Error Message'));
```

This code will display an error message with the text 'This is an Error Message' in a modal dialog and throw an exception."
You are a Frappe framework expert.,I need to get user input. How can I do that using the `frappe.prompt` function?,"The `frappe.prompt` function is used to prompt the user for a value or list of values. You can pass a label, a field definition (df), or a list of fields as arguments to the function. Here are some examples:

```javascript
// prompt for single value of type Data
frappe.prompt('First Name', ({ value }) => console.log(value))

// Set title and button label
frappe.prompt('First Name', console.log, 'Enter First Name', 'Submit');

// prompt for single value of any type
frappe.prompt({
  label: 'Birth Date',
  fieldname: 'date',
  fieldtype: 'Date'

    fieldtype: 'Data'
  },
  {
    label: 'Last Name',
    fieldname: 'last_name',
    fieldtype: 'Data'
  },
], (values) => {
  console.log(values.first_name, values.last_name);
})
```

These examples show how to prompt the user for a single value of type Data, a single value of any type, and a list of values."
You are a Frappe framework expert.,I need to show a confirmation dialog before proceeding with an action. What function should I use for that?,"For confirmation dialogs, you should use the `frappe.confirm` function. This function takes a message and two callback functions, one for the 'yes' response and another for the 'no' response.  Here's an example:

```javascript
frappe.confirm('Are you sure you want to proceed?',
  () => {
    // action to perform if Yes is selected
  },
  () => {
    // action to perform if No is selected
  }
);
```

This code will display a confirmation dialog with the message 'Are you sure you want to proceed?'. If the user clicks 'Yes', the first callback function will be executed. If the user clicks 'No', the second callback function will be executed."
You are a Frappe framework expert.,I need to show a warning dialog to the user. How can I do that using the Frappe API?,"You can use the `frappe.warn` function to show a warning dialog. This function takes several arguments: the title of the dialog, the message, a callback function to be executed when the user confirms, the label of the primary button, and an optional flag to make the dialog minimizable. Here's an example:

```javascript
frappe.warn('Are you sure you want to proceed?',
  'There are unsaved changes on this page',
  () => {
    // action to perform if Continue is selected
  },
  'Continue',
  true // Sets dialog as minimizable
);
```

This code will display a warning dialog with the title 'Are you sure you want to proceed?' and the message 'There are unsaved changes on this page'. The dialog will have a 'Continue' button that will trigger the callback function when clicked. The dialog will also be minimizable."
You are a Frappe framework expert.,What is the difference between `frappe.show_alert` and `frappe.msgprint`? ,"The key difference between `frappe.show_alert` and `frappe.msgprint` is their intrusiveness.  `frappe.msgprint` displays a modal dialog that requires user interaction to close, while `frappe.show_alert` shows a non-obstructive message at the bottom of the screen that automatically disappears after a specified duration. 

`frappe.show_alert` is ideal for non-critical messages like system notifications, while `frappe.msgprint` is better for important information requiring user acknowledgement."
You are a Frappe framework expert.,How can I use the `frappe.show_progress` function?,"The `frappe.show_progress` function is used to display a progress bar. It takes four arguments: the title of the progress bar, the current progress (count), the total progress (total), and a description. Here's an example:

```javascript
frappe.show_progress('Loading..', 70, 100, 'Please wait');
```

This code will display a progress bar with the title 'Loading..', a current progress of 70%, a total progress of 100%, and the description 'Please wait'. You can update the progress bar by calling `frappe.show_progress` again with updated values for `count` and `total`."
You are a Frappe framework expert.,I want to create a new document. How do I do that using the Frappe API?,"You can use the `frappe.new_doc` function to create a new document. This function takes three arguments: the DocType of the document you want to create, an optional object of route options to initialize fields, and an optional callback function. Here are some examples:

```javascript
// Create a new Task
frappe.new_doc('Task');

// Create a new Task with an initial subject
frappe.new_doc('Task', { subject: 'New Task' });

// Create a new Task with an initial subject and description
frappe.new_doc('Task', { subject: 'New Task' }, doc => {
  doc.description = 'Do what's necessary';
});
```

The `route_options` argument can be used to set the initial values for certain field types (Link, Select, Data, Dynamic Link). The `init_callback` function allows you to perform any additional initialization of the document before it is displayed to the user."
You are a Frappe framework expert.,I need to create a dialog that lets the user select multiple items from a list. What function should I use for this?,"For multiple item selection dialogs, you should use the `frappe.ui.form.MultiSelectDialog` class. This class allows you to define the DocType of the items to be selected, the target where the dialog should be displayed, filter fields, a query for fetching the items, and a callback function to be executed when the user selects the items. Here is an example:

```javascript
new frappe.ui.form.MultiSelectDialog({
  doctype: 'Material Request',
  target: this.cur_frm,
  setters: {
    schedule_date: null,
    status: 'Pending'
  },
  add_filters_group: 1,
  date_field: 'transaction_date',
  get_query() {
    return {
      filters: { docstatus: ['!=', 2] }
    }
  },
  action(selections) {
    console.log(selections);
  }
});
```

This code will create a dialog that allows the user to select multiple Material Requests that fulfill the specified filter criteria. The `action` function will be executed when the user clicks the 'Submit' button, and it will receive an array of the selected items as its argument."
You are a Frappe framework expert.,What are the advantages of using the Frappe Dialog API for building custom dialogs?,"The Frappe Dialog API offers several advantages when building custom dialogs within your applications:

You are a Frappe Framework expert.,Can you explain what RealtimeChart is in Frappe?,"RealtimeChart is a class in Frappe's Chart API that allows you to build interactive charts that update in real-time based on data received from a socket event.  It's built on top of the standard Frappe Chart API, giving you a powerful and flexible way to visualize dynamic data."
You are a Frappe Framework expert.,How do I create a RealtimeChart instance?,"You create a RealtimeChart instance using the `frappe.ui.RealtimeChart` class. You need to provide the HTML element where the chart will be rendered, the name of the socket event that will provide data updates, the maximum number of labels allowed on the x-axis, and initial data for the chart. For example:

```javascript
let chart = new frappe.ui.RealtimeChart('#chart', 'test_event', 8, {
  title: 'My Realtime Chart',
  data: data,
  type: 'line',
  height: 250,
  colors: ['#7cd6fd', '#743ee2']
});
```

This code creates a RealtimeChart called 'My Realtime Chart' that will be displayed in the HTML element with the ID 'chart'. It listens to the socket event 'test_event' and allows a maximum of 8 labels on the x-axis."
You are a Frappe Framework expert.,How do I actually start updating the RealtimeChart?,"After initializing the RealtimeChart instance, you need to start listening to the socket event. You can do this using the `start_updating()` method:

```javascript
frappe.ui.RealtimeChart.start_updating();
```

This will begin pulling in data from the specified socket event and updating the chart accordingly."
You are a Frappe Framework expert.,What if I want to stop the RealtimeChart from updating?,"You can use the `stop_updating()` method to stop the chart from updating:

```javascript
frappe.ui.RealtimeChart.stop_updating();
```

This will halt the listening process and prevent further updates to the chart."
You are a Frappe Framework expert.,Is there a way to manually update the RealtimeChart?,"Yes, you can manually update the RealtimeChart using the `update_chart()` method. This method takes a label and an array of data points as arguments. For example:

```javascript
frappe.ui.update_chart(2, [30]);
```

This code would append a label '2' to the chart with a data point of 30. This allows you to add data to the chart even if there isn't a corresponding socket event."
You are a Frappe Framework expert.,Where can I find more information about the Frappe Chart API?,You can find detailed documentation on the Frappe Chart API here: [https://frappe.io/charts](https://frappe.io/charts). The documentation covers everything from basic chart creation to advanced features and customization options.
You are a Frappe Framework expert.,Can you tell me how to publish data to the socket event so that my RealtimeChart can update?,"You can publish data to a socket event using the `frappe.publish_realtime()` function. This function takes the event name and the data you want to publish as arguments. The data should be in a dictionary format with keys representing the label and points for the chart. For example:

```python
data = {'label': 1, 'points': [10]}
frappe.publish_realtime('test_event', data)
```

This code publishes a dictionary with a label of 1 and a single data point of 10 to the socket event named 'test_event'.  You can run this code as a cron job using the [Hook](https://frappeframework.com/docs/v14/user/en/python-api/hooks) functionality to automatically update the chart at regular intervals."

You are a Frappe expert.,Can you provide an example of how to add a Frappe App to a site?,"First, download the app from its Git repository using `bench get-app https://github.com/org/app_name`. Then, install it to your site with `bench --site site_name install-app app_name`."
You are a Frappe expert.,Where can I find more information about Frappe Apps?,You can find comprehensive documentation about Frappe Apps on the official Frappe Framework website: [https://frappeframework.com/docs/user/en/guides/basics/apps](https://frappeframework.com/docs/user/en/guides/basics/apps).
You are a Frappe framework expert.,What is Frappe.call?,"Frappe.call is a method in the Frappe framework used to manage AJAX calls, allowing asynchronous communication between the client (browser) and the server. It enables you to send requests to the server and handle responses via a callback mechanism. This makes it easier to update parts of a web page without needing to reload the entire page."
You are a Frappe framework expert.,Can you explain the structure of frappe.call?,"Frappe.call is used with a JavaScript object that has several parameters:

* **method:** The dotted path to a whitelisted backend method (server-side function) that you want to call.
* **type:** The HTTP request type (default is ""POST""). You can specify methods like ""GET"", ""PUT"", or ""DELETE"".
* **args:** An associative array containing the arguments you want to pass to the server-side method.
* **success:** A callback function that executes when the server request is successful. It receives the response from the server as an argument.
* **error:** A callback function that executes when the server request fails. It receives the error details as an argument.
* **always:** A callback function that executes regardless of whether the request was successful or failed. It receives the response or error details as an argument.
* **btn:** The triggering object (like a button) that initiated the call.
* **freeze:** A boolean value (default is false) that freezes the UI until the response is received (useful for preventing user interaction during loading).
* **freeze_message:** A message to display on the screen while the UI is frozen.
* **async:** A boolean value (default is true) that makes the call asynchronous (non-blocking). Set it to false to make the call synchronous (blocking).
* **url:** The URL where the request should be sent. If omitted, it defaults to the current page's URL."
You are a Frappe framework expert.,How do I use frappe.call to call a standard API?,"You can use frappe.call to interact with standard APIs like the `frappe.client.get_value` method to retrieve data from a DocType. For example, to get information from the ""Item"" DocType based on an item code, you'd use the following structure:

```javascript
frappe.call({
  method: 'frappe.client.get_value',
  args: {
    'doctype': 'Item',
    'filters': {'name': item_code},
    'fieldname': [
      'item_name',
      'web_long_description',
      'description',
      'image',
      'thumbnail'
    ]
  },
  callback: function(r) {
    if (!r.exc) {
      // Code snippet to process the data (r.message) if the request is successful
    }
  }
});
```

In this example:
* `method`:  Calls the `frappe.client.get_value` API method.
* `args`:
  * `doctype`: The name of the DocType ('Item' in this case).
  * `filters`: A condition that specifies what item to retrieve (using the item code 'name').
  * `fieldname`: An array of fields that you want to fetch from the DocType.
* `callback`: A function that will be executed after the request. The `r` object will contain the response, including data (`r.message`) and any error (`r.exc`).

Remember that `frappe.client.get_value` is a standard API method, so you don't need to whitelist it separately."
You are a Frappe framework expert.,How do I call whitelisted functions in Frappe using frappe.call?,"To call custom server-side functions using frappe.call, you need to make sure those functions are whitelisted. This is essential for security. Here's how it works:

1. **Whitelist the Server-Side Function:**
   * In your server-side Python code (usually a file within your custom app), use the `@frappe.whitelist()` decorator above the function you want to make accessible through frappe.call.

   ```python
   @frappe.whitelist()
   def get_all_roles():
       # Business logic to fetch all roles
       # ...
       return value  # Return the data you want to send back to the client
   ```

2. **Call the Function from the Client (JavaScript):**
   * In your client-side JavaScript, use frappe.call to call the whitelisted function. The `method` parameter should be the dotted path to the server-side function. For example:

   ```javascript
   frappe.call({
     method: ""frappe.core.doctype.user.user.get_all_roles"",  // Dotted path to the server-side function
     callback: function(r) {
       if (!r.exc) {
         // Process the returned data (r.message) if the request was successful
       }
     }
   });
   ```

**Key Points:**
* Whitelisting ensures that only authorized functions are accessible via frappe.call.
* The `method` parameter in frappe.call should match the dotted path of the whitelisted function.
* The whitelisted function on the server-side should return the data you want to send back to the client."
You are a Frappe framework expert.,I'm working with the 'Frappe Ajax Call' documentation on the Frappe Framework website. Can you tell me more about the `async` parameter in frappe.call?,"The `async` parameter in `frappe.call` determines whether the call is asynchronous or synchronous. By default, `async` is set to `true`, meaning the call is asynchronous. Here's what that implies:

* **Asynchronous Call (async: true):**
    * The JavaScript code will continue executing after the `frappe.call` is made, without waiting for the server response. This allows your application to remain responsive while the server is processing the request. The callback functions (`success`, `error`, `always`) will be executed when the server responds. 

* **Synchronous Call (async: false):**
    * The JavaScript code will halt execution and wait for the server response before proceeding. This can block the browser from responding to user interactions while the call is in progress. Use synchronous calls with caution, as they can impact your application's performance and responsiveness. You might use them in situations where you absolutely need the server's response before continuing, but it's generally recommended to use asynchronous calls for a smoother user experience."
You are a Frappe framework expert.,What is the purpose of the `freeze` and `freeze_message` parameters in frappe.call?,"The `freeze` and `freeze_message` parameters in `frappe.call` are useful for providing visual feedback to the user during long-running server operations. 

* **freeze:** When set to `true`, it freezes the user interface (UI) of your application, preventing user interaction until the server response is received. This is particularly useful when you're making a request that could take some time, such as saving data to the database or fetching a large dataset.

* **freeze_message:** This parameter allows you to display a custom message on the screen while the UI is frozen. This message can inform the user about the ongoing process and provide them with a clear indication of what's happening. You can use it to show messages like ""Saving data..."", ""Loading..."", or ""Please wait..."" to give the user a visual cue about the status of the request.

By using `freeze` and `freeze_message`, you can create a more user-friendly experience, preventing unexpected behavior or confusion during long-running operations. It ensures that the user is informed about what's happening, and the UI is not left in an unresponsive state."
You are a Frappe framework expert.,I'm reading about using frappe.call to interact with APIs. What are the benefits of using AJAX calls in Frappe?,"Using AJAX calls (specifically, `frappe.call`) in Frappe offers several benefits that enhance the user experience and application performance:

* **Partial Page Updates:** AJAX allows you to update specific parts of a web page without reloading the entire page. This makes for faster and smoother interactions for the user. For example, you can update a table row or display a message without refreshing the entire page.

* **Improved Responsiveness:** Asynchronous calls don't block the browser's main thread. This means the user can continue interacting with the application while the server is processing a request. This leads to a more responsive and user-friendly experience, as the application feels faster and more dynamic.

* **Better User Experience:** AJAX helps to create a more dynamic and interactive web experience. You can create features like live search, auto-completion, and real-time data updates without the need for full page refreshes.

* **Enhanced Performance:** By only loading necessary data when it's needed, AJAX can reduce the overall amount of data transferred between the browser and the server, resulting in faster load times and improved performance.

* **Modular Design:** AJAX encourages a more modular approach to web application development. You can separate front-end and back-end logic more effectively, making code easier to maintain and debug."
You are a Frappe framework expert.,I'm looking at the documentation for frappe.call. What's the purpose of the `btn` parameter?,"The `btn` parameter in `frappe.call` is primarily used to identify the triggering object that initiated the AJAX call. This is most commonly used when you have a button or other UI element that triggers a server-side action via frappe.call.

Here's how it works:

* **Identifying the Source:** The `btn` parameter usually holds a reference to the DOM element (like a button) that initiated the call. This allows the server-side logic to understand where the call originated from. For example, if you have multiple buttons that trigger different actions, the `btn` parameter helps distinguish between them.

* **Providing Context:** By passing the triggering object, you can provide context to the server-side logic. This might be helpful if you need to perform different actions based on the source of the call. For instance, you might have different responses based on whether the call originated from a 'Save' button, a 'Cancel' button, or a 'Delete' button.

* **Visual Feedback:** In some cases, the `btn` parameter can be used to provide visual feedback to the user while the AJAX call is being processed. For example, you might disable the button or change its appearance to indicate that the call is in progress."

You are a Frappe Framework expert.,Can you explain what 'sites' are in the context of the Frappe Framework?,"In Frappe, a 'site' represents a tenant or a separate instance of your application. It's like having a separate, isolated copy of your app for each customer or organization. This allows you to manage different data and configurations independently. Think of it as a multi-tenant platform where each tenant has its own space within the framework."
You are a Frappe Framework expert.,Where are these sites stored within the Frappe Framework?,"Sites are stored within a directory named 'sites'. This directory is considered the working directory when you're running Frappe commands, like starting a Celery worker or a WSGI server. You can customize the location of this directory using the `SITES_DIR` environment variable or the `--sites_dir` option when executing Frappe commands."
You are a Frappe Framework expert.,What are some of the files and directories typically found within the 'sites' directory?,"The 'sites' directory is important for managing your sites and their configuration. Here are some key files and directories you'll find within it:

* **apps.txt:** This file lists all the Python packages that are treated as Frappe apps for your site. These apps are essential for your site's functionality and need to be included in your Python path.

* **common_site_config.json:** This optional file stores configurations that apply to all sites on your platform. It allows you to define settings that are shared across multiple tenants.

* **assets:** This directory contains the assets that are served to the browser client, such as JavaScript files, CSS stylesheets, and images. These assets are automatically generated using the `bench build` command.

* **languages.txt:** This file is autogenerated and maps each language to its corresponding code. This file helps the framework handle multilingual support.

* **individual site directories:** Each site in Frappe has its own directory within the 'sites' directory. These directories contain the site's specific configuration and data."
You are a Frappe Framework expert.,What is the purpose of the 'site_config.json' file and what kind of settings are usually stored there?,The 'site_config.json' file is crucial for configuring each individual site. It contains settings specific to that particular tenant.  You can find more details about these configuration options by visiting the official documentation link: [See configuration options for `site_config.json`](/docs/v14/user/en/basics/sites#site-config).
You are a Frappe Framework expert.,How does the framework decide which site to serve when a user makes a request?,"Frappe handles site resolution automatically based on the HTTP request.  The framework looks for these headers in the request to determine the correct site:

* **Host:** If the 'Host' header matches a registered site in your platform, that site is selected.

* **X-Frappe-Site-Name:** You can explicitly specify the site name using this header if needed.

If neither of these headers matches a site, the framework might use other criteria or default settings to handle the request."
You are a Frappe Framework expert.,Is there a way to force the development server to serve a specific site?,"Yes, you can force the development server to serve a specific site by using the `bench --site SITENAME serve` command. Replace `SITENAME` with the name of the site you want to serve. This command ensures that the server will only process requests for that particular site."
You are a Frappe Framework expert.,How do I add a new site to my Frappe instance?,"Adding a new site is straightforward. In your bench instance, execute the command: `bench new-site SITENAME`.  Replace `SITENAME` with the desired name for your new site."
You are a Frappe Framework expert.,What if I want to make a specific site the default one for my instance?,"To set a site as the default, use the command: `bench use SITENAME`. This sets that site as the primary one for your instance.  You can confirm this by checking the `currentsite.txt` file within your 'sites' folder. It should contain the name of the site you designated as the default."
You are an expert on Frappe Framework.,I'm trying to understand how translations work in Frappe. Where do I find the text that needs to be translated?,"The text that needs to be translated in Frappe comes from various sources, like Javascript and Python code files, HTML templates, workspace definitions, and DocTypes. These sources contain strings that need to be translated for different languages."
You are an expert on Frappe Framework.,I see the `frappe._` method mentioned. What is its purpose?,"The `frappe._` method in Python and the `__` method in Javascript are used to mark strings in the code that need to be translated.  When the application runs, these methods are used to retrieve the translated version of the string based on the user's preferred language."
You are an expert on Frappe Framework.,How does Frappe actually load the translations during execution?,"When a translation is needed, Frappe gathers all the translation dictionaries from all the installed apps and stores them in memcache.  Then, based on the user's language preference or the specific request's requirements, the appropriate translations are loaded and used to replace the original strings."
You are an expert on Frappe Framework.,I want to add a new language to my Frappe instance. What's the process for doing that?,"Adding a new language to Frappe is similar to adding new translations.  You'll need to export the strings, translate them, import the translations, update the `languages.txt` files in the appropriate directories, commit your changes, and finally send a pull request.  You can use tools like Google Translator Toolkit or Bing Translator to help with the translation process."

            label: __(""Custom Link Option""),
            value: ""custom__link_option"",
            action: () => {}
        }
    ];
}
```

This code defines a custom link option labeled ""Custom Link Option"" with an icon and a specific value. The `action` property allows you to define the behaviour when the link is clicked."
You are a Frappe Framework expert.,I'm not sure I understand the `action` property. Can you explain its purpose?,"Absolutely! The `action` property is where you define the functionality that will be triggered when the custom link option is selected. It essentially allows you to execute a specific piece of code or action. You can use it to perform various operations, such as opening a new window, navigating to a different page, triggering a function, or executing a custom workflow. You can even use it to interact with other elements on the page.  

For instance, you might want to open a modal dialog, submit a form, or update a specific field when the custom link is clicked. The `action` property gives you control over the behaviour of your custom link option."
You are a Frappe Framework expert.,Can you give me a specific example of how to use the `action` property to open a modal dialog?,"Certainly! Here's how you can use the `action` property to open a modal dialog when the custom link is clicked:

```python
frappe.ui.form.ControlLink.link_options = function(link) {
    return [
        {
            html: ""<span class=""text-primary link-option"">""
                + ""<i class=""fa fa-search"" style=""margin-right: 5px;""></i> ""
                + __(""Open Modal"")
                + ""</span>"",
            label: __(""Open Modal""),
            value: ""open_modal"",
            action: () => frappe.ui.form.open_dialog({ // Opens a modal dialog
                title: ""My Modal Title"",
                fields: [ // Defines the fields for the modal
                    { fieldtype: ""Text"", label: ""Name"", fieldname: ""name"" },
                    { fieldtype: ""Data"", label: ""Date"", fieldname: ""date"" }
                ],
                primary_action: { // Defines the primary action button
                    label: __(""Save""),
                    action: () => {  // Code to execute on save
                        console.log(dialog.get_values()); // Access modal values
                        // ... Further actions
                    }
                }
            })
        }
    ];
}
```

This code defines a custom link option with the label ""Open Modal"", and when it's clicked, it triggers the `frappe.ui.form.open_dialog` function to open a modal dialog with specific fields. The `primary_action` property defines the action to be performed when the modal's primary button is clicked. You can modify the `fields`, `title`, and `primary_action` properties to customize the appearance and functionality of the modal dialog."
You are a Frappe Framework expert.,Can you explain how to execute code when a DocType is saved in Frappe?,"To execute code when a DocType is saved in Frappe, you need to write your logic within the DocType's controller module. This module is located in the `doctype` folder within the Module of the DocType.  For example, the controller for the 'ToDo' DocType would be found in `frappe/desk/doctype/todo/todo.py`."
You are a Frappe Framework expert.,What are the different events I can trigger code on for a DocType?,"You can trigger code on the following events for a DocType:

1. **`autoname`:** This method is called while naming the DocType, allowing you to set the `self.name` property.
2. **`before_insert`:** This method is called before a DocType is inserted into the database.
3. **`validate`:** This method is called before a DocType is saved. You can throw an exception here to prevent the save if needed.
4. **`on_update`:** This method is called after the DocType is inserted or updated in the database.
5. **`on_submit`:** This method is called after the DocType is submitted.
6. **`on_cancel`:** This method is called after the DocType is canceled.
7. **`on_trash`:** This method is called after the DocType is deleted."
You are a Frappe Framework expert.,I want to validate a field in my DocType before it's saved. How would I do that?,"You can use the `validate` method in your DocType's controller module to validate a field.  For example, if you wanted to ensure that a field called 'email' contains a valid email address, you could add the following code to your `validate` method:

```python
from frappe import throw

class MyDocType(Document):
    def validate(self):
        if not frappe.validate_email(self.email):
            throw(_('Invalid Email'), title=_('Error'))
```

This code will check if the email field contains a valid email address. If it doesn't, it will throw an exception and prevent the DocType from being saved."
You are a Frappe Framework expert.,Where can I find more information about how to use these events and methods in my DocType?,"You can find a comprehensive guide on executing code on DocType events in the Frappe Framework documentation: [https://frappeframework.com/docs/user/en/guides/app-development/executing-code-on-doctype-events](https://frappeframework.com/docs/user/en/guides/app-development/executing-code-on-doctype-events).  This documentation provides detailed explanations and examples for each event and method, helping you understand how to effectively utilize them in your custom applications."
You are a Frappe Framework expert.,I'm trying to understand how to improve standard controls in Frappe. Can you explain the basic idea behind this article?,"This article guides you through adding translation capabilities to Frappe's standard controls. It tackles the challenge of managing translations across numerous records and doctypes, making it more efficient. The core idea is to use the 'options' field of a DocField to mark controls as 'Translatable' and then leverage custom code to dynamically add a translation dialog."
You are a Frappe Framework expert.,Why is it important to identify the 'Control' or 'Widget' when adding translations?,"Identifying the control is crucial because it represents the element that holds the text or data you want to translate. By targeting the control, you ensure your translation logic applies to the right place in the application. If you directly target a field or a Doctype, you might end up making translations redundant across many instances of that field or Doctype. By targeting the 'Control,' you ensure efficient and focused translations."
You are a Frappe Framework expert.,I see that the article mentions using the 'options' field in DocFields. How does this relate to adding translations?,"The 'options' field in a DocField acts like a control switch for our translation logic. By setting the 'options' field of a DocField to 'Translatable,' we signal to the custom code that this particular field needs translation. This allows us to selectively apply the translation functionality only to the intended controls. You can think of it as a tag for the system to identify which controls require translation functionality."
You are a Frappe Framework expert.,I noticed the code snippet mentions a 'TranslationSelector'. What is this and how does it fit into the translation process?,"The 'TranslationSelector' is a custom dialog that appears when you click the translation button next to a 'Translatable' field. This dialog provides a user interface for selecting and managing translations for the text currently displayed in the field. When the user selects a translation, the 'TranslationSelector' updates the field with the chosen translated text. This ensures that the user can easily select and manage translations directly within the context of the application."
You are a Frappe Framework expert.,This article mentions extending the 'ControlData' class. Why is extending this class necessary for implementing this translation functionality?,"Extending the 'ControlData' class is essential because it allows us to modify the behavior of standard Frappe controls. By overriding the 'make_input' method, we can introduce the new translation button and its associated logic. Similarly, overriding the 'setup_button' method allows us to activate the translation dialog when the button is clicked. This extension mechanism provides the flexibility to add custom features to existing control components without having to rewrite them from scratch."
You are a Frappe Framework expert.,"Where can I find more information on how to customize the 'options' field in DocFields, as mentioned in the article?","The article itself provides a reference to a related knowledge base article: [this article](https://kb.erpnext.com/kb/customize/creating-custom-link-field). This article explains how to customize the 'options' field in general. It serves as a good starting point for understanding the different ways to use this field to influence the behavior of Frappe controls, including the specific customization for translations discussed in the article you're reading."
You are a Frappe framework expert.,I'm looking to improve performance by running some tasks in the background. Can you tell me how to use background jobs in Frappe?,"Absolutely! Frappe uses Python RQ for background jobs. This allows you to queue tasks that can be processed by background workers, freeing up your web workers to handle other requests. This is especially helpful for long-running tasks that could otherwise consume your resources."
You are a Frappe framework expert.,Can you give me an example of how to enqueue a job using Frappe's background job system?,"Certainly! Here's an example: 

```python
import frappe

def long_job(arg1, arg2):
    frappe.publish_realtime('msgprint', 'Starting long job...')
    # This job takes a long time to process
    frappe.publish_realtime('msgprint', 'Ending long job...')

def enqueue_long_job(arg1, args2):
    frappe.enqueue('myapp.mymodule.long_job', arg1=arg1, arg2=arg2)
```

This code defines a function `long_job` which represents your background task.  The `enqueue_long_job` function uses `frappe.enqueue` to add the `long_job` to the default queue for background processing. 

You can also specify different queues like `long` or `short` depending on the estimated execution time of your job."
You are a Frappe framework expert.,Are there any other ways to run background jobs in Frappe besides using `frappe.enqueue`?,"Yes, you can also trigger background jobs directly from document objects by using the `queue_action` method.  This is particularly useful when you want to execute actions like `save`, `submit`, or `cancel` asynchronously, especially if the operation involves a large amount of data.

For instance, you could modify the `submit` method of a document to run it in the background if it has more than 100 items:

```python
def submit(self):
    if len(self.items) > 100:
        self.queue_action('submit')
    else:
        self._submit()  # Original submit logic
```"
You are a Frappe framework expert.,How can I debug background jobs in Frappe?,"If you're running Frappe using `bench start`, you can view the logs in your terminal to monitor background job activity.  However, remember that the default worker doesn't automatically restart, so you'll need to stop and restart `bench` after making changes to your code to ensure they take effect."
You are a Frappe framework expert.,I'm interested in learning more about the different queues available for background jobs in Frappe. Can you tell me more about them?,"Sure! Frappe provides several queues for managing background jobs, each with a different priority level: 

* **`default`:** This is the standard queue where most background jobs are placed. 
* **`long`:**  Use this queue for jobs that are expected to take a significant amount of time. 
* **`short`:**  This queue is for jobs that are generally shorter and require quicker processing. 
* **`worker_long`:** This is specifically for longer jobs, and `worker_short` is for shorter ones. 

Choosing the appropriate queue helps optimize the execution of your background tasks by ensuring that more urgent jobs are processed first."
You are a Frappe framework expert.,I noticed you mentioned using `frappe.publish_realtime` in the example for `long_job`. What's the purpose of that?,"That's a great question! `frappe.publish_realtime` is used to send real-time updates to the user interface. In the context of background jobs, it allows you to provide feedback to the user about the progress of the long-running task. For instance, in the example, we send 'Starting long job...' and 'Ending long job...' messages to display updates to the user while the `long_job` function is being executed."
You are a Frappe framework expert.,I'm working on a project with a large amount of data and need to process it in the background. What are some best practices for using background jobs in such scenarios?,"Here are some tips for using background jobs effectively when dealing with large datasets:

1. **Break down tasks:**  If possible, divide your large processing task into smaller, manageable chunks. This allows you to run each chunk as a separate background job, improving performance and making it easier to manage progress. 
2. **Use appropriate queues:**  Choose queues based on the estimated time it takes to complete each task. Longer tasks belong in `long` or `worker_long` queues, while shorter tasks can be assigned to `short` or `worker_short`. 
3. **Prioritize critical jobs:** If you have some jobs that are more crucial than others, prioritize them by using the `at_front` parameter in the `enqueue` method. This ensures they are processed sooner. 
4. **Handle errors gracefully:** Implement robust error handling mechanisms to catch and log any errors that occur during background job execution. This will help you identify and resolve issues quickly. 
5. **Monitor progress:**  Use `frappe.publish_realtime` or other real-time communication methods to provide updates to the user about the progress of background jobs. This keeps users informed and enhances the overall user experience."
You are a Frappe Framework expert.,How do I add a custom button to a form in Frappe?,"You can add a custom button to a form in Frappe by editing the Javascript file associated with the Doctype. For example, to add a button to the User form, you would edit `user.js`. You need to define a new method called `add_custom_button` which will add the button to your form."
You are a Frappe Framework expert.,Can you give me an example of how to add a custom button to the User form?,"Sure. You would need to edit the `frappe/core/doctype/user/user.js` file. Within this file, you can use the `add_custom_button` function to create your button. For example, you could add a button to display the user's email address like this:

```javascript
frappe.ui.form.on('User', {
  refresh: function(frm) {
    // ... other code ...
    frm.add_custom_button(__('Get User Email Address'), function() {
      frappe.msgprint(frm.doc.email);
    }, __(""Utilities""));
    // ... other code ...
  }
});
```

This code would add a button labeled 'Get User Email Address' to the User form, and when clicked, it would display the user's email address in a message box."
You are a Frappe Framework expert.,What is the purpose of the `add_custom_button` function?,"The `add_custom_button` function allows you to add custom buttons to your forms in Frappe. This provides a way to add functionality to your forms that is not provided by default. The function takes three arguments: the button's label, a callback function that will be executed when the button is clicked, and the group name where the button should be placed."
You are a Frappe Framework expert.,Where can I learn more about adding custom buttons in Frappe?,"You can find more information on this topic in the Frappe Framework documentation. You can access the documentation at [https://frappeframework.com/docs/user/en/guides/app-development/adding-custom-button-to-form](https://frappeframework.com/docs/user/en/guides/app-development/adding-custom-button-to-form). This guide provides a comprehensive explanation of adding custom buttons to forms, including examples and best practices."
You are a Frappe Framework expert.,I'm building an app with a parent DocType called 'Item' and a child DocType called 'Item Color'. I want to trigger an event when a row in the 'Item Color' child table is deleted. How do I do that?,"You can trigger an event when a row in the 'Item Color' child table is deleted by adding a handler to the `fieldname_remove` event. The `fieldname` should be the name of the child table field in your parent DocType declaration. In this case, it would be `color_remove`. 

You can add the handler within the `frappe.ui.form.on('Item Color', {...})` function. Here's an example:

```javascript
frappe.ui.form.on('Item Color', {
  color_remove: function(frm) {
    // Your code here
    // For example, you could log the remaining color list:
    console.log(frm.doc.color);
  }
});
```

This handler will be triggered whenever a row in the 'Item Color' child table is deleted."
You are a Frappe Framework expert.,Can you give me an example of how to use the `fieldname_add` event handler?,"Certainly! The `fieldname_add` event handler is triggered when a new row is added to the child table. Let's assume your parent DocType is 'Item' and the child table field is named 'color'. Here's how you'd use the `color_add` event handler:

```javascript
frappe.ui.form.on('Item Color', {
  color_add: function(frm) {
    // Your code here
    // For example, you could automatically set a default value for a field in the new row:
    frm.doc.color[frm.doc.color.length - 1].color_code = 'Default Color';
  }
});
```

In this example, whenever a new row is added to the 'Item Color' table, the `color_code` field in the newly added row will automatically be set to 'Default Color'. You can replace this with any custom logic you need to perform when a new row is added."
You are a Frappe Framework expert.,What are the other event handlers available for child tables besides `fieldname_add` and `fieldname_remove`?,"Besides `fieldname_add` and `fieldname_remove`, there are two other event handlers available for child tables in Frappe Framework: 

1. **`fieldname_move`:** This event handler is triggered when a row in the child table is moved up or down. It provides information about the row that was moved and its new position in the table.
2. **`fieldname_before_remove`:** This event handler is triggered just before a row in the child table is deleted. It allows you to perform actions before the deletion takes place, such as validating data or displaying a confirmation message to the user. You can cancel the deletion if needed by setting `frm.events.stop_action = true` inside this handler.

These event handlers provide flexibility in managing child table rows and allow you to execute custom actions based on user interactions."
You are a Frappe Framework expert.,Where can I find more information about the `frappe.ui.form.on` function and how it works?,"You can find more detailed information about the `frappe.ui.form.on` function in the Frappe Framework documentation. The specific page you're looking for is likely to be within the 'App Development' section of the documentation. You can access this documentation at [https://frappeframework.com/docs/user/en/guides/app-development/](https://frappeframework.com/docs/user/en/guides/app-development/). This page covers various aspects of app development, including the use of `frappe.ui.form.on` for managing events and interactions within your application."
You are a Frappe framework expert.,I'm looking for a way to display simple messages to users in my Frappe app. What options do I have?,"Frappe provides several dialog types for user interaction. For displaying simple messages, the 'Alert Dialog' is a great choice. It's non-obtrusive and can be used for displaying short messages or notifications. You can control the duration it's displayed using the 'seconds' parameter."
You are a Frappe framework expert.,Can you give me an example of how to use the Alert Dialog?,"Certainly! To show a message 'Hi, do you have a new message' for 5 seconds, you would use the following code:

```javascript
show_alert('Hi, do you have a new message', 5);
```

This will display the message in a non-intrusive alert box for 5 seconds."
You are a Frappe framework expert.,I need to collect some basic information from users. Which dialog type would be suitable for this?,"For collecting data, the 'Prompt Dialog' is the best option. It allows you to define fields for users to input data, such as text, dates, or even custom fields. You can also define a callback function to process the submitted data."
You are a Frappe framework expert.,I want to ask users for their birth date. How can I do this using the Prompt Dialog?,"Here's an example of how to create a prompt dialog to get a user's birth date:

```javascript
frappe.prompt([
  {'fieldname': 'birth', 'fieldtype': 'Date', 'label': 'Birth Date', 'reqd': 1}
], 
function(values) {
  show_alert(values, 5); // You can process the 'values' here
}, 
'Age verification', 
'Subscribe me'
);
```

This code defines a single field for 'birth' as a Date field and includes a callback function to handle the submitted data. You can customize the title and button label as needed."
You are a Frappe framework expert.,"I'm building a feature where users can delete data. Before proceeding, I want to confirm their action. How can I achieve this?","For confirmation dialogs, you can use the 'Confirm Dialog' type. It displays a message asking for confirmation and provides 'Yes' and 'Cancel' buttons with corresponding callbacks."
You are a Frappe framework expert.,Can you show me an example of how to use the Confirm Dialog before deleting data?,"```javascript
frappe.confirm(
  'Are you sure you want to delete this data?', 
  function() {
    // Proceed with the deletion logic here
  }, 
  function() {
    // Display a message if the user cancels
  }
);
```

In this example, the dialog asks 'Are you sure you want to delete this data?' If the user confirms, the first callback function is executed, where you would implement the deletion logic. If they cancel, the second callback function is triggered, allowing you to provide feedback."
You are a Frappe framework expert.,I'm working on a feature that needs to present information in a structured format. Which dialog type should I use?,"For displaying structured information, the 'Message Print' dialog is an ideal choice. It allows you to present information using HTML formatting, making it very versatile for displaying data in a visually appealing way."
You are a Frappe framework expert.,"I want to display server status information, including memory usage, processor usage, and disk space. How can I do this with the Message Print dialog?","```javascript
msgprint(""<b>Server Status</b>"" 
        + ""<hr/>"" 
        + ""<ul>"" 
                + ""<li><b>28%</b> Memory</li>"" 
                + ""<li><b>12%</b> Processor</li>"" 
                + ""<li><b>0.3%</b> Disk</li>"" 
        + ""</ul>"", 'Server Info')
```

This code will display the server status information in a well-formatted dialog with headings and list items. You can customize the content and formatting to match your specific needs."
You are a Frappe framework expert.,I need more flexibility in creating custom dialogs with unique layouts and features. Is there a way to build my own dialogs?,"Absolutely! Frappe provides the `frappe.ui.Dialog` class, which allows you to create custom dialogs with complete control over their structure, fields, and actions. You can add any type of field, style the dialog using CSS, and define custom actions using JavaScript functions."
You are a Frappe framework expert.,Can you give me an example of creating a custom dialog with a simple HTML field and a date field?,"```javascript
var d = new frappe.ui.Dialog({
  'fields': [
    {'fieldname': 'ht', 'fieldtype': 'HTML'},
    {'fieldname': 'today', 'fieldtype': 'Date', 'default': frappe.datetime.nowdate()}
  ],
  primary_action: function() {
    d.hide();
    show_alert(d.get_values()); // You can process the values here
  }
});
d.fields_dict.ht.$wrapper.html('Hello World');
d.show();
```

This code creates a custom dialog with an HTML field displaying 'Hello World' and a date field with the current date as the default value. The primary action closes the dialog and displays the collected values in an alert."
You are a Frappe Framework expert.,How can I override the standard link query in Frappe?,You can override the standard link query using the `set_query` method within the Client Script DocType. This method is available in the Frappe Desk interface.
You are a Frappe Framework expert.,Can you give me an example of adding filters to the query?,"Certainly! Here's an example of adding filters to the query using `set_query`:

```javascript
frappe.ui.form.on(""Bank Reconciliation"", ""onload"", function(frm) {
    frm.set_query(""bank_account"", function() {
        return {
            ""filters"": {
                ""account_type"": ""Bank"",
                ""group_or_ledger"": ""Ledger""
            }
        };
    });
});
```

This script will filter the 'bank_account' link field within the 'Bank Reconciliation' DocType to only show accounts with 'account_type' as 'Bank' and 'group_or_ledger' as 'Ledger'."
You are a Frappe Framework expert.,How do I call a different method to generate results for the link query?,"You can call a server-side method to generate results for the link query. For instance:

```javascript
frm.set_query(""item_code"", ""items"", function() {
    return {
        query: ""erpnext.controllers.queries.item_query"",
        filters: frm.doc.enquiry_type === ""Maintenance"" ?
            {""is_service_item"": ""Yes""} : {""is_sales_item"": ""Yes""}
    };
});
```

This example sets the query to call the `item_query` method within the `erpnext.controllers.queries` module. The filters applied depend on the value of `frm.doc.enquiry_type`. This allows you to customize the query dynamically based on other data in the form."
You are a Frappe Framework expert.,What parameters does the custom server-side method take?,"The custom server-side method takes these parameters:

```python
def custom_query(doctype, txt, searchfield, start, page_len, filters)
```

- `doctype`: The DocType of the link field being queried.
- `txt`: The search text entered by the user.
- `searchfield`: The field on which the search is being performed.
- `start`: The starting index of the results.
- `page_len`: The number of results to fetch.
- `filters`: Additional filters applied to the query."
You are a Frappe Framework expert.,Could you explain the purpose of the `@frappe.whitelist()` and `@frappe.validate_and_sanitize_search_inputs` decorators in the example `lead_query` function?,"You're right to ask about those decorators!  They play crucial roles in security and data integrity:

1. **`@frappe.whitelist()`:**  This decorator marks the `lead_query` function as safe to be called from the client-side (your web browser).  Without it, the function would be inaccessible from the front-end due to security restrictions. It allows your custom query to interact with the database from the client-side in a controlled manner.

2. **`@frappe.validate_and_sanitize_search_inputs`:** This decorator is incredibly important for security. It validates and sanitizes the user inputs (like search terms) passed to the `lead_query` function. This prevents potential SQL injection attacks, which could be used to manipulate the database or steal data. It effectively acts as a shield against malicious input."
You are a Frappe Framework expert.,Where can I find more examples of custom queries in Frappe?,You can find more examples of custom queries in the `erpnext/controllers/queries.py` file within the ERPNext source code.

You are a Frappe Framework expert.,I'm trying to set up a new Connected App in Frappe. Can you tell me what it is and how it works?,"A Connected App in Frappe allows your Frappe instance to access other web services on your behalf. This is done using OAuth 2.0, a standard protocol for authorization. You can think of it as a secure way for your Frappe application to interact with services like Google Mail, or other services that support OAuth 2.0."
You are a Frappe Framework expert.,So how do I actually set up a new Connected App?,"You'll need to create a new Connected App in your Frappe instance and give it a name.  Then, you'll need to configure the OpenID Configuration URL for the service you want to connect to. You can usually find this URL at `.well-known/openid-configuration`.  Frappe will then automatically retrieve the necessary authorization and token endpoints."
You are a Frappe Framework expert.,"Okay, what if I don't know the OpenID Configuration URL?","If you don't know the OpenID Configuration URL, you can manually enter the Authorization URI and Token URI. The Authorization URI is where you'll be redirected to give your consent, and the Token URI is the endpoint for exchanging an authorization code for an access or refresh token. You can find these URLs in the documentation of the specific service you're connecting to."
You are a Frappe Framework expert.,"Once I've set up the Connected App, what do I do next?",You'll then need to register the Redirect URI from your Connected App with the third-party service you're connecting to. This involves creating new OAuth 2.0 client credentials and specifying the Redirect URI and authorized JavaScript origins (the domain name of your Frappe instance). Make sure you copy the Client ID and secret from the third-party service back to your Connected App in Frappe.
You are a Frappe Framework expert.,What about scopes? How do I define what my Frappe instance can access?,"Scopes define the permissions your Frappe instance will have for the connected service.  You'll need to specify the necessary scopes in your Connected App setup, and these will determine what data your application can access.  Refer to the documentation of the third-party service to see what scopes are available."
You are a Frappe Framework expert.,Can you give me an example of how to use extra parameters?,"Yes, for example, when connecting to Google Mail, you might need to add the parameter `access_type=offline` to ensure that your Frappe instance can access the email inbox in the background and refresh the access token without user intervention.  This is usually documented by the service provider."
You are a Frappe Framework expert.,"Okay, so once I have everything set up, how do I actually connect to the service?","You and your users can click on the 'Connect to...' button in your Frappe instance. This will open a new browser tab where you'll be asked to authorize your Frappe instance to access the service. After granting permission, you'll be redirected back to your Frappe instance."
You are a Frappe Framework expert.,So what happens behind the scenes after I connect?,"In the background, your Frappe server will exchange the authorization code it received during the redirect for a temporary access token, and possibly a refresh token. These tokens allow your Frappe instance to securely access the third-party service on your behalf.  You can then use the Connected App to integrate the functionality of the service into your Frappe applications."
You are a Frappe Framework expert.,How do I add a custom icon to my Frappe module?,"To create a custom icon for your Frappe module, you need to create an SVG file and set its path in your app's `desktop/config.py` file.  This icon will be loaded using AJAX the first time the module is accessed, and then it will be rendered. You can find a good source for SVG icons at the Noun Project website: [http://thenounproject.com/](http://thenounproject.com/)"
You are a Frappe Framework expert.,Can you give me an example of how to add a custom icon?,"Certainly!  Here's an example of how to add a custom icon for a module called 'Frappe Apps':

```python
from frappe import _

def get_data():
    return {
        ""Frappe Apps"": {
            ""color"": ""orange"",
            ""icon"": ""assets/frappe/images/frappe.svg"",
            ""label"": _('Frappe.io Portal'),
            ""type"": ""module""
        }
    }
```

In this example, the icon path is set to `assets/frappe/images/frappe.svg`. Remember to replace this path with the actual path to your SVG file."

This guide covers various aspects of module development, including creating custom icons."
You are a Frappe Framework expert.,How can I insert a new ToDo document using the Frappe API?,"You can use the `frappe.get_doc` method to create a new ToDo document and then call the `insert()` method to save it. For example:

```python
todo = frappe.get_doc({""doctype"":""ToDo"", ""description"": ""test""})
todo.insert()
```

This code will create a new ToDo document with the description ""test"" and then save it to the database."
You are a Frappe Framework expert.,What if I need to insert a document without the user's permissions being checked?,"You can use the `ignore_permissions` parameter when calling the `insert()` method. For example:

```python
todo = frappe.get_doc({""doctype"":""ToDo"", ""description"": ""test""})
todo.insert(ignore_permissions = True)
```

This code will insert the document without checking the user's permissions."
You are a Frappe Framework expert.,Can I submit a document immediately after inserting it?,"Yes, you can use the `submit()` method after calling the `insert()` method. For example:

```python
todo = frappe.get_doc({""doctype"":""ToDo"", ""description"": ""test""})
todo.insert(ignore_permissions=True)
todo.submit()
```

This code will first insert the document and then submit it, which means that the document will be marked as complete and ready for further processing."
You are a Frappe Framework expert.,How do I insert a document when another document is saved?,"You can use the `on_update()` method in your custom document type to insert the new document when the other document is saved. For example:

```python
class MyType(Document):
    def on_update(self):
        todo = frappe.get_doc({""doctype"":""ToDo"", ""description"": ""test""})
        todo.insert()
```

This code will automatically insert a new ToDo document whenever the `MyType` document is updated."
You are a Frappe Framework expert.,Can I insert a document with child tables?,"Yes, you can create a document with child tables and then insert it using the `insert()` method. For example:

```python
sales_order = frappe.get_doc({
    ""doctype"": ""Sales Order"",
    ""company"": ""_Test Company"",
    ""customer"": ""_Test Customer"",
    ""delivery_date"": ""2013-02-23"",
    ""sales_order_details"": [
        {

            ""qty"": 10.0,
            ""rate"": 100.0,
            ""warehouse"": ""_Test Warehouse - _TC""
        }
    ]
})
sales_order.insert()
```

This code will create a new Sales Order document with a child table called `sales_order_details` and then insert it to the database."
You are a Frappe Framework expert.,Where can I find more information about using the Frappe API to insert documents?,You can find more detailed information about using the Frappe API to insert documents in the official Frappe Framework documentation.

You are a Frappe framework expert.,How can I add custom fields to DocTypes during app installation?,You can add custom fields to DocTypes during app installation by defining them within your app and exporting them as fixtures. This process ensures that the fields are automatically added to the relevant DocTypes when your app is installed on a new site.
You are a Frappe framework expert.,What are fixtures in Frappe?,"Fixtures are essentially data files that contain the definition of objects like custom fields, DocTypes, and other elements required for your app. They are used to populate the database with the necessary information during app installation or update."
You are a Frappe framework expert.,How do I export these fixtures for my custom fields?,"You can use the `bench export-fixtures` command to export your custom fields as fixtures. This will create a `fixtures` folder in your app directory, containing `.csv` or `.json` files with the definitions of your custom fields."
You are a Frappe framework expert.,Where do I add the code to tell Frappe to export custom fields as fixtures?,You should add the line `fixtures = ['Custom Field']` inside your app's `hooks.py` file. This instructs Frappe to include the custom field definitions in the exported fixtures.
You are a Frappe framework expert.,Can I add other objects as fixtures besides custom fields?,"Yes, you can add other objects like DocTypes (e.g., 'Website Settings') as fixtures. Just include their names in the `fixtures` list within your `hooks.py` file."
You are a Frappe framework expert.,Where can I find more information about creating and using custom fields in Frappe?,You can find comprehensive documentation on custom fields and other aspects of Frappe app development at [https://frappeframework.com/docs/user/en/guides/app-development/how-to-create-custom-fields-during-app-installation](https://frappeframework.com/docs/user/en/guides/app-development/how-to-create-custom-fields-during-app-installation).
You are an expert on the Frappe framework.,How do I use HTML templates in JavaScript within the Frappe framework?,"To use HTML templates in JavaScript within Frappe, you'll need to create an HTML file and include it in your app's build.json. Then, you can render the template using the `frappe.render` function. For example, you could create a template named `address_list.html` and render it using `frappe.render(frappe.templates.address_list, {[context]})`."
You are an expert on the Frappe framework.,What are the different ways to embed code within an HTML template in Frappe?,"In Frappe, we use the Jinja-like `{% raw %}{%{% endraw %}` tags to embed code within HTML templates. This is different from the standard `&lt;%` tags."
You are an expert on the Frappe framework.,Are there any restrictions when using single quotes in HTML templates?,"Yes, you should avoid using single quotes `'` inside your HTML templates. It's best practice to stick with double quotes."
You are an expert on the Frappe framework.,I'm interested in learning more about the `frappe.render` function. Could you provide an example of how to use it?,"Certainly! Let's say you have a template called `address_list.html` and you want to render it with some data. You could use the following code: 

```javascript
frappe.render(frappe.templates.address_list, { 
  addr_list: [ // Your address data here ]
});
```

This would render the `address_list.html` template using the data provided in the `addr_list` array."
You are an expert on the Frappe framework.,Where can I find more information on using HTML templates in the Frappe framework?,You can find a detailed explanation and examples in the official Frappe Framework documentation. The specific guide on using HTML templates can be found here: [https://frappeframework.com/docs/user/en/guides/app-development/using-html-templates-in-javascript](https://frappeframework.com/docs/user/en/guides/app-development/using-html-templates-in-javascript)
You are a Frappe Framework expert.,I'm trying to develop an app using Frappe. What is Developer Mode and why should I use it?,"Developer Mode is crucial for building and customizing Frappe applications.  When you make changes to DocTypes, Reports, or other application components in design mode, you'll want those changes to be reflected in the actual app repository. Developer Mode ensures those changes are saved and affect the application you're building. It's like enabling a 'live update' for your development environment."
You are a Frappe Framework expert.,How do I actually enable Developer Mode? I'm on a fresh Frappe install.,You'll need to update the `site_config.json` file. The file is located at `frappe-bench/sites/{your site}/site_config.json`. You can enable Developer Mode by either using the `bench set-config -g developer_mode 1` command inside the `frappe-bench` folder or manually modifying the `site_config.json` file and setting the `"developer_mode": 1` property.
You are a Frappe Framework expert.,"I've enabled Developer Mode, but I'm getting an error. What should I do?","After enabling Developer Mode, it's important to clear the cache to ensure the changes are applied correctly. You can do this by running the command `bench --site {your site} clear-cache`. If the error persists, you may also need to install additional dependencies required for development. You can install them using the command `bench setup requirements --dev`."
You are a Frappe Framework expert.,I'm having trouble seeing the Developer icon. I'm logged in as the Administrator user. What am I missing?,"To see the Developer icon, you need to enable it in your Desktop settings. You can do this by going to `Desk -> User dropdown list -> Set Desktop Icons` and then checking the ""Developer"" box. This will add the Developer icon to your Frappe desktop, providing you access to additional development tools and options."
You are a Frappe Framework expert.,I want to fetch the GSTIN of a supplier into a Purchase Order. How can I achieve this?,"You can achieve this by creating custom fields for GSTIN in both the Supplier and Purchase Order doctypes.  There are two scenarios you can follow, depending on whether you want the GSTIN field to be constantly updated or allow for user input."
You are a Frappe Framework expert.,Can you explain the scenario where the GSTIN field is constantly updated?,"In this scenario, you'll need to create a custom field called 'GSTIN' in the Supplier doctype with a field type of 'Data'. Then, create another custom field called 'GSTIN' in the Purchase Order doctype with a field type of 'Read Only' and set the 'Fetch From' property to `supplier.gstin`. This ensures that whenever you save the Purchase Order, the GSTIN will be automatically updated based on the supplier's data. It's important to note that this approach overwrites user input, so if you need the flexibility to enter data manually, you'll need to use the second scenario."
You are a Frappe Framework expert.,What if I want to allow user input for GSTIN if the value isn't found in the Supplier doctype?,"In this scenario, you'll create the 'GSTIN' custom field in both the Supplier and Purchase Order doctypes with a field type of 'Data'.  In the Purchase Order doctype, you'll set the 'Fetch From' property to `supplier.vat_number` and check the 'Fetch If Empty' checkbox.  This way, when creating a new Purchase Order, the system will fetch the GSTIN from the Supplier if available. If the GSTIN is not found, you can manually enter it.  The system will only fetch the GSTIN from the Supplier again when saving the Purchase Order if the field is empty."
You are a Frappe Framework expert.,Where can I find more information about custom fields in Frappe?,"You can find detailed information on custom fields in the Frappe Framework documentation, specifically in the section on [Custom Fields](https://frappeframework.com/docs/user/en/guides/app-development/custom-fields). This section covers all aspects of custom fields, including creating, editing, and managing them for various doctypes."
You are an expert on the Frappe Framework.,How can I add icons to modules on my Frappe desktop?,"To add icons to modules on your Frappe desktop, you need to edit the `config/desktop.py` file within your app's directory. This file allows you to define the icon parameters for each module. You can also create a separate file like `config/MODULE_NAME.py` to manage dropdown actions associated with the module. Refer to the documentation on [Adding Module Icons On Desktop](https://frappeframework.com/docs/user/en/guides/app-development/adding-module-icons-on-desktop) for detailed instructions and code examples."
You are an expert on the Frappe Framework.,Can you give me an example of how to add an icon to the 'Library Management' module?,"Sure! In your `config/desktop.py` file, add a `get_data` function returning a dictionary with the icon parameters for 'Library Management'. Here's an example: 

```python
def get_data():
    return [
        {
            ""module_name"": ""Library Management"",
            ""category"": ""Modules"",
            ""label"": ""Library Management"",
            ""color"": ""#589494"",
            ""icon"": ""octicon octicon-book"",
            ""type"": ""module"",
            ""description"": ""Library management""
        }
    ]
```

This will add the 'octicon octicon-book' icon to the 'Library Management' module on your desktop."
You are an expert on the Frappe Framework.,What if I want to add a dropdown list of actions when I click on the 'Library Management' module?,"You'll need to create a separate file named `config/library_management.py`. Inside this file, define a `get_data` function that returns a list of dictionaries containing the actions for the module. Each dictionary should specify the 'type', 'name', 'label', 'description', and 'onboard' attributes. For example:

```python
def get_data():
    return [
        {
            ""label"": ""Library Management"",
            ""icon"": ""octicon octicon-book"",
            ""items"": [
                {
                    ""type"": ""doctype"",
                    ""name"": ""Article"",
                    ""label"": ""Article"",
                    ""description"": ""Manage Books"",
                    ""onboard"": 1,
                },
                {
                    ""type"": ""doctype"",
                    ""name"": ""Library Member"",
                    ""label"": ""Library Member"",
                    ""description"": ""Manage Members"",
                    ""onboard"": 0,
                }
            ]
        }
    ]
```

This will create a dropdown list with 'Article' and 'Library Member' options when you click on the 'Library Management' module."
You are an expert on the Frappe Framework.,What is the purpose of the 'onboard' attribute in the dropdown actions?,"The 'onboard' attribute determines whether an action is displayed in the dropdown list or only after clicking on the module. If 'onboard' is set to 1, the action will be shown in the dropdown list. If it's set to 0, the action will be visible only after the user clicks on the module. This allows you to organize and prioritize actions for your module's dropdown."
You are a Frappe Framework expert.,Can you explain what a Single Type Doctype is in Frappe?,"In Frappe, a Single Type Doctype is a special type of DocType that doesn't have an associated table like regular DocTypes. It's designed to store a single set of data, making it similar to the Singleton pattern in Java. Think of it as a global setting or a form that holds configuration information. This is useful for things like system settings or wizards that don't require storing multiple records."
You are a Frappe Framework expert.,How does a Single Type Doctype store its data?,"Instead of having its own table, data from a Single Type Doctype is stored in a special table called `tabSingles`.  This table has three columns: `doctype`, `field`, and `value`. Each row represents a field and its corresponding value for that particular Single Type Doctype."
You are a Frappe Framework expert.,Can you give me some real-world examples of Single Type DocTypes in Frappe?,"Sure! In Frappe, 'System Settings' and 'Customize Form' are both great examples of Single Type DocTypes. The 'System Settings' DocType stores global configuration options for the Frappe application, while 'Customize Form' lets you modify the layout and behavior of various forms within your app."
You are a Frappe Framework expert.,Where can I find more information about Single Type DocTypes in Frappe?,You can find a detailed explanation of Single Type DocTypes and how to work with them in the Frappe Framework documentation. Here's the link: https://frappeframework.com/docs/user/en/guides/app-development/single-type-doctype
You are a Frappe framework expert.,Can you explain what a 'Connected App' is in the context of the Frappe Framework?,"A 'Connected App' is a crucial component for integrating third-party services into your Frappe application. It acts as a bridge, storing essential information like client IDs, secrets, scopes, and endpoints. This allows your Frappe application to securely communicate with the platform you're integrating with, such as Google, using OAuth 2.0 authentication."
You are a Frappe framework expert.,I understand that a 'Connected App' is used for integration. How do I actually use it in my Frappe application?,"You'll need to create a 'Connected App' instance first. You can do this through the Frappe interface. Once you have the 'Connected App' set up, you'll create a settings DocType (like 'Google Settings') within your application. This DocType will have a link field that points to your 'Connected App'. This allows you to easily manage the connection between your application and the external service."
You are a Frappe framework expert.,I'm confused about the authentication process. Can you clarify how a user would connect to the external service?,"Once the 'Connected App' is linked to your settings DocType, users can connect to the external service in two ways. They can either open the 'Connected App' and click the 'Connect to...' button, which will initiate the OAuth 2.0 flow. Alternatively, you can provide a custom button or redirect within your application that uses the 'initiate_web_application_flow()' method of the 'Connected App' instance to get the authorization URI. After the user grants permission, they will be redirected back to your application, and you can obtain an authenticated session using the 'get_oauth2_session()' method."
You are a Frappe framework expert.,"So, after the user is authenticated, what can I do with the authenticated session?","The authenticated session allows your application to make secure requests to the external service. You can use the 'session.get()' method to retrieve any allowed resources. The session will handle automatic refresh of the access token if it expires, so you don't have to worry about managing token validity yourself."
You are a Frappe framework expert.,Where can I find more information about this 'Connected App' concept and its usage?,"You can find more detailed documentation on the Frappe Framework website. Specifically, the documentation for 'Connected Apps' can be found at: [https://frappeframework.com/docs/user/en/guides/app-development/connected-app](https://frappeframework.com/docs/user/en/guides/app-development/connected-app). You can also refer to the 'Prerequisites' section of the documentation for 'Generic OAuth Client', which explains the process with a Google example: [https://frappeframework.com/docs/user/en/guides/app-development/generic-oauth-client](https://frappeframework.com/docs/user/en/guides/app-development/generic-oauth-client)."
You are a Frappe Framework expert.,How do I add a social login provider to my Frappe app?,You can add a social login provider to your Frappe app by following the steps outlined in the documentation on [https://frappeframework.com/docs/user/en/guides/app-development/adding-social-login-provider](https://frappeframework.com/docs/user/en/guides/app-development/adding-social-login-provider). This involves defining the provider's details in the `SocialLoginKey.get_social_login_provider` dictionary and adding the provider key to the `social_login_provider` select field on the `Social Login Key` DocType.
You are a Frappe Framework expert.,What are the different ways to authenticate users using OpenID Connect?,"The documentation mentions two common approaches for OpenID Connect authentication in Frappe:  

1. **User Creation via OpenID Profile Endpoint:** This method retrieves user information from the provider's OpenID Profile endpoint. You'll need to define a whitelisted method, like `login_via_frappe`, to handle the authentication process and user creation. 

2. **User Creation via id_token:**  This method uses the `id_token` provided by the provider to authenticate and create a user. You'll need to define a whitelisted method, like `login_via_office365`, to handle the authentication and user creation using the `id_token`."
You are a Frappe Framework expert.,What happens after the user authorizes the social login provider?,"Once the user authorizes the provider, the provider's API server sends an 'Authorization Code' to the redirect URL specified in the `SocialLoginKey.get_social_login_provider` dictionary. You'll then need to create a whitelisted method (like `login_via_office365` or `login_via_frappe`) in `frappe.integrations.oauth2_logins` to handle the authorization code and complete the user authentication process."
You are a Frappe Framework expert.,I'm not familiar with whitelisted methods. Can you explain what those are?,"In Frappe, whitelisted methods are functions that are specifically designated to be accessible to users, even if they're not logged in or if they are guest users.  This allows you to handle actions like social logins, where you need to authenticate users before they can access your application's main features."
You are a Frappe Framework expert.,How can I export custom fields and property setters to my app?,"You can export customizations to your app by going to the **Customize Form** section for the DocType you've modified. You'll see a button called **Export Customizations** where you can select the module and choose whether to sync these customizations after every update. The customizations will be saved in a `custom` folder within the module folder of your app, named after the DocType. You can then sync them to the app by running `bench update` or `bench migrate`."
You are a Frappe Framework expert.,Where can I find more information about exporting customizations in the Frappe Framework?,You can find detailed instructions on exporting customizations in the Frappe Framework documentation at https://frappeframework.com/docs/user/en/guides/app-development/exporting-customizations.
You are a Frappe Framework expert.,What happens when I sync customizations to my app using `bench update` or `bench migrate`?,"When you sync customizations using `bench update` or `bench migrate`, all property setters and custom permissions on your site are replaced with what's defined in the code. It's important to be aware of this behavior as it can overwrite any existing customizations."
You are a Frappe Framework expert.,How are the customizations stored within the app after exporting?,"After exporting, the customizations are stored in a `custom` folder within the module folder of your app. The folder is named after the DocType that was customized. This ensures that all the customizations for a specific DocType are grouped together and can be easily managed."
You are a Frappe Framework expert.,Is there a way to avoid overwriting customizations when using `bench update` or `bench migrate`?,"If you don't want to overwrite existing customizations, you should avoid using the **Export Customizations** feature. You can instead manually create and manage the customizations in the `custom` folder. This gives you more control over your customizations and prevents accidental overwrites."
You are a Frappe framework expert.,What is caching and how does it work in Frappe Framework?,"Caching is a technique used to store frequently accessed data in a temporary location, like an in-memory database, to speed up retrieval. In Frappe Framework, caching is implemented using Redis, a fast in-memory key-value store. Redis is spawned as a separate service by the 'bench' and each Frappe web/background worker can connect to it using `frappe.cache`. By storing frequently used data in Redis, Frappe avoids making repetitive database queries, significantly improving performance."
You are a Frappe framework expert.,Can you explain how to use strings and hashes in Redis caching with Frappe?,"Sure. Redis supports several data types. For simple key-value pairs, you can use strings:

```python
frappe.cache.set_value(""key"", ""value"")
frappe.cache.get_value(""key"")
```

For more complex data, hashes are used. Imagine them as dictionaries stored in Redis. You can set and retrieve values for individual fields:

```python
frappe.cache.hset(""user|admin"", ""name"", ""Admin"")
frappe.cache.hset(""user|admin"", ""email"", ""admin@example.com"")
frappe.cache.hget(""user|admin"", ""name"")
frappe.cache.hgetall(""user|admin"")
```"
You are a Frappe framework expert.,How does Frappe handle cached documents and what are the benefits?,"Frappe offers an inbuilt function `frappe.get_cached_doc` to fetch documents directly from the cache instead of hitting the database. This is very beneficial when dealing with data that doesn't change frequently, like user settings. Retrieving a document from the cache is significantly faster than querying the database, leading to quicker response times. Frappe automatically tries to invalidate the cache whenever changes are made to documents via `doc.save` or `frappe.db.set_value`. This ensures that the cached data remains relevant. However, it's important to note that if raw database queries are used, the cache invalidation might not be triggered."
You are a Frappe framework expert.,I'm working on a function that performs a lengthy computation. How can I implement custom caching for it?,"You can implement custom caching for long computations using `frappe.cache`. The most important step is to generate a unique key based on the inputs of your function. This key is used to store and retrieve the cached result. Here's a simple example:

```python
def slow_add(a, b):
    key = f""slow_addition|{a}+{b}""  # Unique key based on inputs
    if cached_value := frappe.cache.get_value(key):
        return cached_value
    # Perform computation
    result = a + b
    frappe.cache.set_value(key, result)  # Store result in cache
    return result
```"
You are a Frappe framework expert.,What are some strategies for preventing stale cache data in custom caching?,"Two key strategies are recommended:

1. **Short TTL:** Set a short Time To Live (TTL) when storing cached values. This ensures that the cache automatically expires after a set time. You can use `expires_in_sec` argument when setting the value:

```python
frappe.cache.set_value(key, result, expires_in_sec=60*60)  # Expires in one hour
```

2. **Manual Cache Clearing:**  Manually clear the cache when the data being cached is modified. This is done using `frappe.cache.delete_value(key)` or `frappe.cache.hdel` for hashes. This ensures the cache stays up-to-date."
You are a Frappe framework expert.,I see there's a `@redis_cache` decorator. How can I use it to quickly cache my functions?,"The `@redis_cache` decorator is a convenient way to automatically cache function results. You can apply it to any function that might be slow. Here's an example:

```python
from frappe.utils.caching import redis_cache

@redis_cache
def slow_function(a, b):
    # Perform lengthy computation
    return a + b
```

The first call to `slow_function` will take the usual time, but subsequent calls with the same arguments will retrieve the cached result, making it much faster."
You are a Frappe framework expert.,How can I invalidate the cache for a function that uses `@redis_cache`?,"You can invalidate the cache for a `@redis_cache` decorated function in two ways:

1. **TTL:**  Set a suitable expiry period (TTL) for the cache. The decorator accepts a `ttl` argument: `@redis_cache(ttl=60)` would cause the cached value to expire after 60 seconds.

2. **Manual Clearing:**  Call the function's `clear_cache` method to manually clear the cache. Here's an example:

```python
@redis_cache
def slow_function(...):
    ...

def invalidate_cache():
    slow_function.clear_cache()
```"
You are a Frappe framework expert.,Where can I find the Redis configuration settings for Frappe?,"The Redis configuration file is located in the `{bench}/config/` directory. When you start the bench, it launches the Redis server based on the settings in this file. A sample config looks like this:

```
dbfilename redis_cache.rdb
dir /home/user/benches/develop/config/pids
pidfile /home/user/benches/develop/config/pids/redis_cache.pid
bind 127.0.0.1
port 13000
maxmemory 737mb
maxmemory-policy allkeys-lru
appendonly no

save """"
```

You can adjust the `maxmemory` setting to increase the maximum memory allocated for caching, but it's generally not recommended to modify other settings."
You are a Frappe framework expert.,How does Frappe ensure multi-tenancy with Redis caching?,"Frappe handles multi-tenancy by internally prefixing cache keys with site context information. So, even if you call `frappe.cache.set_value(""key"")` from two different sites on the same bench, it will create separate entries for each site. This is done by the `frappe.cache.make_key` function, which includes site context in the key generation."
You are a Frappe framework expert.,Can Frappe handle complex data types like documents in the cache?,"Yes, Frappe uses the `pickle` module to serialize complex objects like documents into bytes. This makes it easy to store and retrieve them in the cache without the need for manual serialization/deserialization. You can find more information about pickling in the Python documentation: <https://docs.python.org/3/library/pickle.html>"
You are a Frappe framework expert.,Is there a client-side cache in Frappe for Redis?,"Yes, Frappe implements a client-side cache on top of the Redis cache within `frappe.local.cache`. This avoids repeated calls to Redis within the same request or job. If a request needs data that's already fetched from Redis, the client cache will provide it directly, eliminating unnecessary Redis calls and improving performance."
You are a Frappe framework expert.,How do I add a map to my DocType form?,You can add a map to your DocType form by adding a field of type 'Geolocation'. This will display a map by default.  You can then customize it further.
You are a Frappe framework expert.,Can I change the default location and zoom level of the map?,"Yes, you can change the default location and zoom level of the map. However, you'll need to create a custom app and modify the `map_defaults.js` file to change these settings. This will affect all maps in your system."
You are a Frappe framework expert.,How do I customize the appearance of a particular map in my DocType?,"You can customize the appearance of a particular map by overwriting the controller methods of the Geolocation field. You can do this using a Client Script or a hook in a custom app. For example, you can change the color of polygons by overriding the `on_each_feature` method."
You are a Frappe framework expert.,Where can I learn more about the controller methods for customizing maps?,You can find more information about the controller methods in the Leaflet documentation: [https://leafletjs.com/examples/geojson/](https://leafletjs.com/examples/geojson/). This documentation will guide you on how to use methods like `point_to_layer` and `set_style` for map customization.
You are a Frappe Framework expert.,What are Packages in Frappe Framework?,Packages are lightweight applications built within the Frappe Framework UI. They resemble apps and are essentially collections of Module Defs.  Think of them as a way to bundle a set of custom features and functionality for easy sharing and deployment across different Frappe sites.
You are a Frappe Framework expert.,How do I create a Package in Frappe?,"To create a Package, you simply create a Package object in the Frappe UI. You can optionally add a README and a LICENSE for documentation and licensing information. The Package structure is designed to be easily managed and shared through a git repository."
You are a Frappe Framework expert.,How do I add a Module Def to my Package?,"You need to set the 'Package' property for your 'Custom' Module Def.  This property links the Module Def to your Package, effectively adding it to the collection of features within your Package."
You are a Frappe Framework expert.,What is a Package Release in Frappe?,"A Package Release essentially packages all the modules associated with your Package into a single, self-contained archive. This archive, a gzipped tarfile, allows you to easily distribute and install the Package on other Frappe sites."
You are a Frappe Framework expert.,How do I import a Package into a new Frappe site?,"You can create a 'Package Import' object on the new site and attach the previously exported Package archive. By checking the 'Activate' checkbox, you trigger the extraction of the Package into the site's 'packages' folder, overwriting any existing files. This process also initiates a migration of the Package to the database, similar to the way app migrations work."
You are a Frappe Framework expert.,Can you give me a specific example of how Packages could be useful?,"Imagine you've built a custom module to manage customer support tickets within Frappe. You can package this module, along with any necessary dependencies, into a Package. This Package can then be shared with other organizations using Frappe, allowing them to easily implement the same ticket management system on their own sites without having to rebuild it from scratch."
You are a Frappe framework expert.,How does Frappe handle failed background jobs?,"Frappe logs failed jobs in the Scheduler Log and `logs/worker.error.log`. It also creates a lock file to prevent the job from running again until the issue is resolved. If the lock file exists for more than 10 minutes, a `LockTimeoutError` is raised."
You are a Frappe framework expert.,I want to receive email notifications for scheduler errors. How do I configure this?,"You can configure email notifications by creating a file named `sites/common_site_config.json` with the following JSON content:

```json
{
  ""celery_error_emails"": {
    ""ADMINS"": [
      [
        ""Person 1"",
        ""person1@example.com""
      ],
      [
        ""Person2 "",
        ""person2@example.com""
      ]
    ],
    ""SERVER_EMAIL"": ""exceptions@example.com""
  }
}
```

This will send email notifications to the specified addresses when a scheduler error occurs. You can customize the email addresses and server email as needed."
You are a Frappe framework expert.,What is the limitation of using email notifications for failed background jobs in Frappe?,The current implementation relies on the local mail server on port 25 to send emails. This means you'll need a working mail server configured on your system to receive these notifications.
You are a Frappe framework expert.,Where can I find more information about this feature?,You can find more information about email notifications for failed background jobs in the Frappe documentation at [https://frappeframework.com/docs/user/en/guides/deployment/email-notifications-for-failed-background-jobs](https://frappeframework.com/docs/user/en/guides/deployment/email-notifications-for-failed-background-jobs).
You are a Frappe Framework expert.,I'm working on a Frappe app and I've made some changes to a DocType. How do I get those changes reflected in my production environment?,You can use the `--latest` or `bench update` command to update your production environment. This will update the site's schema with your DocType changes. You can find more information on how to update your production environment in the [Frappe Framework documentation](https://frappeframework.com/docs/user/en/guides/deployment/how-to-migrate-doctype-changes-to-production).
You are a Frappe Framework expert.,"I've updated my DocType, but the permissions haven't changed. How do I fix this?","Permissions are not automatically updated when you make changes to a DocType. You'll need to manually update them by adding a new patch in the `patches.txt` file of your app. You can use the following code in your patch to reset the permissions for your DocType:

```python
execute:frappe.permissions.reset_perms(""your_doctype_name"")
```

This will update the permissions for your DocType in your production environment."
You are a Frappe Framework expert.,"I'm working in developer mode, does that mean my DocType changes will automatically be reflected in my production environment?","Yes, if you're in developer mode, the `.json` files for your DocTypes will be automatically updated in your production environment when you run `--latest` or `bench update`."
You are a Frappe Framework expert.,What is the purpose of migrations in Frappe?,"Migrations in Frappe are used to handle changes in your project's database schema and data. This is essential as projects often evolve, requiring updates to the database structure or existing data. Frappe provides tools to manage these changes efficiently. You can learn more about it in the documentation here: https://frappeframework.com/docs/user/en/guides/deployment/migrations"
You are a Frappe Framework expert.,How do I apply schema changes in Frappe?,"You can edit a DocType to add, remove, or change fields. When you save a DocType, a JSON file containing the DocType data is added to your app's source tree. This JSON file is used to install DocTypes when you add the app to a site. To make schema changes, you need to enable 'developer_mode' in the Frappe configuration. Once you run `bench migrate`, the doctypes in your system will be synced to their latest versions from the JSON files in the app."
You are a Frappe Framework expert.,What happens to fields when I delete them in a DocType?,Fields in Frappe are soft-deleted. This means the columns are not actually removed from the database table. They will become invisible in documents but remain in the database. This is done to prevent potential data loss and to allow you to write data migrations that may need values from deleted fields. 
You are a Frappe Framework expert.,Can I reverse schema migrations in Frappe?,"No, Frappe doesn't currently support reverse schema migrations. "
You are a Frappe Framework expert.,How do I add a data migration to my Frappe app?,"To add a data migration, you need to write an `execute` function in a Python module and add it to the `patches.txt` file within your app. You can create a new patch interactively by running `bench create-patch`. It's recommended to organize your patches into a directory structure, using patch numbers and names in the file paths."
You are a Frappe Framework expert.,Can I use one-off Python statements in my data migrations?,"Yes, you can add one-off Python statements to `patches.txt` using the syntax `execute:{python statement}`. For example, `execute:frappe.get_doc(""User"", ""Guest"").save()`. Remember that all lines in `patches.txt` must be unique. To run a line twice, you can make it unique by adding a distinct comment."
You are a Frappe Framework expert.,What is the `bench migrate` command used for?,"The `bench migrate` command is used to apply schema changes and data migrations when you pull updates from any Frappe app, including the core Frappe framework itself. It ensures your system is up-to-date with the latest changes."
You are a Frappe Framework expert.,How can I enable social logins on my Frappe site?,"You can enable social logins using services like Facebook, Google, GitHub, or Office 365. This allows users to log in with their existing accounts, making it easier for them to access your Frappe site. To enable this, you'll need to obtain Client ID and Client Secret from each service you want to integrate. These credentials are then used to configure the social login options on your Frappe site."
You are a Frappe Framework expert.,Where do I find the Client ID and Client Secret for Facebook?,"To find the Client ID and Client Secret for Facebook, you need to go to the Facebook Developers website. After creating a new Facebook app, you'll need to go to the Settings > Basic section and set a Contact Email. Then, go to Settings > Advanced and enter the following in the Valid OAuth redirect URIs field: **http://{{ yoursite }}/api/method/frappe.www.login.login_via_facebook**. Once you save these changes, you can find the App ID and App Secret under the Dashboard section. Copy these credentials and paste them into the Desktop > Integration > Authentication > Social Login Key > Client ID and Client Secret fields in your Frappe site."
You are a Frappe Framework expert.,What happens when a user logs in using social logins if they don't have an existing account on my Frappe site?,"When a user logs in using a social login and doesn't have an existing account on your Frappe site, a new user account is created automatically. The system uses the email address provided by the social login service to match with any existing users. If no match is found, a new user account of the default type 'Website User' is created, assuming signup isn't disabled in the website settings. A System Manager can then change the user type to 'System User', allowing them access to the Desktop."
You are a Frappe Framework expert.,I want to use my Frappe site as a login provider for another site. How do I do that?,"You can use your Frappe site as a login provider for another site by setting up OAuth Client on your Frappe site and configuring social login on the other site. For example, let's say you have two sites: Site A (your Frappe site) and Site B. You want to use Site A as the login provider for Site B. Follow these steps: 

1. On Site A (your Frappe site), go to the OAuth Client list and create a new OAuth Client. 
2. Enter an appropriate App Name (something that identifies Site B). 
3. In the Redirect URIs and Default Redirect URI fields, enter `https://siteb.com/api/method/frappe.www.login.login_via_frappe`. 
4. After saving, you'll get the App Client ID and App Client Secret. 
5. On Site B, go to Social Login Key and create a new one. 
6. Enter the Client ID and Client Secret obtained from Site A. 
7. Select Frappe as the Social Login Provider. 
8. Enter `https://sitea.com` as the Base URL and save the document."
You are a Frappe Framework expert.,Where can I find documentation on how to configure social logins with Office 365?,"You can find detailed instructions on how to configure social logins with Office 365 in the official Frappe Framework documentation. You can access this documentation through the link provided in the metadata, which is: [https://frappeframework.com/docs/user/en/guides/deployment/how-to-enable-social-logins](https://frappeframework.com/docs/user/en/guides/deployment/how-to-enable-social-logins)."
You are an expert on the Frappe Framework.,"I'm trying to create a print format in Frappe. How can I access information from another document, like a Sales Order, within the print format?","You can access data from another document within a print format using the `frappe.get_doc` function. For example, if you want to display the customer name from a Sales Order, you can use the following code within your print format template:

```python
{% set sales_order_doc = frappe.get_doc(""Sales Order"", sales_order) %}
{{ sales_order_doc.customer }}
```

This code retrieves the Sales Order document based on the `sales_order` variable (which should hold the Sales Order's DocType name) and then displays the customer name from that document.

You can find more details about this in the Frappe documentation at [https://frappeframework.com/docs/user/en/guides/reports-and-printing/getting-information-from-another-document-in-print-format](https://frappeframework.com/docs/user/en/guides/reports-and-printing/getting-information-from-another-document-in-print-format)."
You are an expert on the Frappe Framework.,"What does the code snippet `{% set sales_order_doc = frappe.get_doc(""Sales Order"", sales_order) %}` do?","This code snippet uses Jinja templating syntax to retrieve a Sales Order document from the Frappe database and store it in a variable called `sales_order_doc`. Here's a breakdown:

* `{% set sales_order_doc = ... %}`: This is a Jinja assignment statement. It assigns the result of the expression on the right-hand side to the variable `sales_order_doc`.
* `frappe.get_doc(""Sales Order"", sales_order)`: This is a Frappe function that retrieves a document from the database.
    * `""Sales Order""`: This is the DocType name of the document to be retrieved (in this case, a Sales Order).
    * `sales_order`: This is a variable that should hold the unique identifier (usually the DocType name) of the specific Sales Order you want to access.

In essence, this code fetches the Sales Order document associated with the `sales_order` variable and makes its data available for use within the print format template."
You are an expert on the Frappe Framework.,I'm working on a print format for a Sales Invoice. How can I display the Sales Order number on the invoice?,"You can use the same `frappe.get_doc` method to retrieve the Sales Order details within your Sales Invoice print format. Assuming your Sales Invoice document has a field named `sales_order` containing the Sales Order's DocType name, you can use the following code:

```python
{% set sales_order_doc = frappe.get_doc(""Sales Order"", doc.sales_order) %}
{{ sales_order_doc.name }}
```

This code fetches the Sales Order document referenced by the `sales_order` field in the current Sales Invoice document (`doc`) and displays its `name` field (which usually represents the Sales Order number). Remember to replace `doc.sales_order` with the actual field name in your Sales Invoice DocType that holds the Sales Order information."
You are a Frappe Framework expert.,Where can I find standard print formats in Frappe?,Standard print formats are automatically generated based on the layout of the DocType you're working with. You can find them within the Frappe application itself. You can also customize them to suit your needs.
You are a Frappe Framework expert.,How can I customize the standard print format?,You can customize standard print formats by going to **Setup > Customize > Customize Form View**. Here you have several options:
You are a Frappe Framework expert.,What are the customization options available?,"You can:
1. **Re-arrange fields:** Drag and drop fields to change their order in the print format.
2. **Add static elements:** Use HTML type fields to insert custom HTML content into your print formats.
3. **Hide fields:** Set the **Print Hide** property for fields you don't want to display in the printed output."
You are a Frappe Framework expert.,Can I create entirely new print format layouts?,"Yes, you can create new print format layouts from scratch using the Jinja Templating Language. Go to **Setup > Printing and Branding > Print Format** to access the creation tools."
You are a Frappe Framework expert.,Are there any resources for learning about creating print formats?,Absolutely! You can find helpful documentation on the Frappe website: [https://docs.erpnext.com/docs/v14/user/manual/en/customize-erpnext/print-format](https://docs.erpnext.com/docs/v14/user/manual/en/customize-erpnext/print-format). You can also utilize the Bootstrap CSS framework ([http://getbootstrap.com](http://getbootstrap.com)) for styling your print formats.
You are a Frappe Framework expert.,Is there anything else that can make creating custom print formats easier?,You can import standard template macros from [https://github.com/frappe/frappe/blob/develop/frappe/templates/print_formats/standard_macros.html](https://github.com/frappe/frappe/blob/develop/frappe/templates/print_formats/standard_macros.html) to quickly add common elements like headers and footers to your print formats.
You are a Frappe Framework expert.,I want to create a report using SQL queries in Frappe. How do I do that?,"You can create tabulated reports using complex SQL queries by creating a new Query Report in Frappe.  You'll need System Manager permissions to do this.  You can find detailed instructions on how to create a Query Report in the Frappe documentation, specifically the ""How To Make Query Report"" guide which you can access at [https://frappeframework.com/docs/user/en/guides/reports-and-printing/how-to-make-query-report](https://frappeframework.com/docs/user/en/guides/reports-and-printing/how-to-make-query-report)."
You are a Frappe Framework expert.,"Okay, I'm ready to create my first Query Report.  What are the steps involved?","Here are the steps to create a Query Report:

1. **Create a new Report:**
   - Set the type as ""Query Report"".
   - Choose a reference DocType (this determines who has access to the report).
   - Select the module where the report should appear (it will show up in the ""Custom Reports"" section).
   - Add your SQL query.

2. **Set the Query:**
   - Define your SQL query using the `SELECT`, `FROM`, `WHERE`, and other clauses as needed.
   - Format the columns by setting labels in the format: `[Label]:[Field Type]/[Options]:[Width]`.

3. **Check the Report:**
   - Preview your report to see how it looks and make sure your query is working correctly.

4. **Advanced (adding filters):**
   - If you're creating a standard report for an app, you can add filters to your query report by adding a `.js` file to the query report folder.
   - Use `%(filter_key)s` in your query where the filter value should be shown."
You are a Frappe Framework expert.,I'm a little confused about the formatting of the columns in the SQL query. Can you give me an example?,"Certainly!  The column formatting in the SQL query helps determine how the data will be displayed in your report.  Here's an example from the documentation:

```sql
SELECT
  `tabProduction Order`.name as ""Production Order:Link/Production Order:200"",
  `tabProduction Order`.creation as ""Date:Date:120"",
  `tabProduction Order`.production_item as ""Item:Link/Item:150"",
  `tabProduction Order`.qty as ""To Produce:Int:100"",
  `tabProduction Order`.produced_qty as ""Produced:Int:100""
FROM
  `tabProduction Order`
WHERE
  `tabProduction Order`.docstatus=1
  AND ifnull(`tabProduction Order`.produced_qty,0) = `tabProduction Order`.qty
  AND EXISTS (SELECT name from `tabStock Entry` where production_order =`tabProduction Order`.name)
```

Let's break down the formatting of the `name` column:

- **""Production Order""**:  This is the label that will be displayed in the report header.
- **:Link/Production Order:200**: This defines the field type as a link and specifies the reference DocType as ""Production Order"". The number `200` sets the width of the column.

You can use different field types, like `Date`, `Int`, or `Link`, along with options and widths to customize the display of your report columns."
You are an expert on the Frappe Framework.,What are Report Print Formats in Frappe?,Report Print Formats are HTML templates that you can use to format Query Report data for printing in Frappe version 4.1 and above. They allow you to customize the presentation of your reports for better readability and professional output.
You are an expert on the Frappe Framework.,How do I create a new Print Format?,"To create a new Print Format, simply place an HTML file within the folder of the query report you want to format. For example, for the General Ledger report in ERPNext, you'd create a file called `general_ledger.html` alongside the existing `.js` and `.py` files."
You are an expert on the Frappe Framework.,Where can I find more information on Print Formats?,You can find more detailed information on Report Print Formats in the Frappe Framework documentation at [https://frappeframework.com/docs/user/en/guides/reports-and-printing/print-format-for-reports](https://frappeframework.com/docs/user/en/guides/reports-and-printing/print-format-for-reports).
You are an expert on the Frappe Framework.,What templating engine is used for Print Formats?,Frappe uses an adapted version of John Resig's microtemplating script for templating Print Formats. This script allows you to use Javascript to define the structure and content of your Print Formats.
You are a Frappe Framework expert.,I'm interested in creating custom reports using server-side scripts. How can I do that in Frappe?,"You can create custom reports using server-side scripts by creating a new Report type called 'Script Report'. These reports offer a powerful way to generate custom reports using Python scripts, providing you with unrestricted access to data."
You are a Frappe Framework expert.,What are the prerequisites for creating a script report?,"You'll need to have Administrator permissions within your Frappe instance to create a script report. Additionally, you must be in Developer Mode to create the report. For detailed instructions on enabling Developer Mode, you can refer to this guide: [https://frappe.io/docs/v14/user/en/guides/app-development/how-enable-developer-mode-in-frappe](https://frappe.io/docs/v14/user/en/guides/app-development/how-enable-developer-mode-in-frappe)."
You are a Frappe Framework expert.,Can you walk me through the steps of creating a new script report?,"Sure! Here's how you create a new script report:

1. **Create a New Report:** Go to the Report section and choose 'Script Report' as the report type. Set 'Is Standard' to 'Yes' and select the relevant module you're working with.  
2. **Set up the Report Folders:** A folder structure will be generated automatically. You'll find a `.js` file for filters and a `.py` file for the Python script.
3. **Add Filters:**  In the `.js` file, you define filters for your report. These properties are similar to those used in defining DocFields within a DocType. You can find an example of how to add filters in the documentation.
4. **Write the Script:**  In the `.py` file, write the Python script to generate the report data. You'll need to define an `execute` method that returns two lists: `columns` (which defines the report columns) and `data` (the actual data for the report).  
5. **Add the Report Link:**  Go to the `config/your_module.py` file and add an entry in the `get_data()` function to display the report link on the module page."
You are a Frappe Framework expert.,I'm interested in the `columns` and `data` lists you mentioned for the script report. Can you provide a more detailed explanation?,"Certainly! Let's break down the `columns` and `data` lists in the `execute` method of your script report:

* **`columns` List:** This list defines the structure and appearance of the report columns. Each column is represented by a dictionary containing information such as:

    * `fieldname`: The name of the field used in the script. 
    * `label`: The display name of the column as it appears in the report. 
    * `fieldtype`: The data type of the column (e.g., 'Link', 'Text', 'Int', 'Date'). 
    * `options`: The reference DocType or list of options if the field is a link field. 
    * `width`: The width of the column in the report (optional). 

* **`data` List:** This list holds the actual data that will be populated in your report. Each element in this list represents a row in the report.  You can use the server-side modules and your Python logic to populate this `data` list based on the filters and conditions you define in your script."
You are a Frappe Framework expert.,Are there any existing script reports that I can refer to as examples?,"Yes, absolutely! You can find several existing script reports in the Frappe framework repository. For example, take a look at the Balance Sheet report in the ERPNext repository: [https://github.com/frappe/erpnext/blob/develop/erpnext/accounts/report/balance_sheet/balance_sheet.py](https://github.com/frappe/erpnext/blob/develop/erpnext/accounts/report/balance_sheet/balance_sheet.py). This will give you a practical demonstration of how the `columns` and `data` lists are structured and how the Python script interacts with the framework to generate the report."
You are a Frappe Framework expert.,How do I create pages for my website using Frappe?,"You can create pages for your website by adding them to the `/www` folder of your Frappe website. The URL of your page will match the path within the `/www` folder. For example, a page located at `/www/about.html` will be accessible at `yourwebsite.com/about`."
You are a Frappe Framework expert.,What file types can I use for my website pages?,You can use `.html` or `.md` (Markdown) files for your website pages.
You are a Frappe Framework expert.,Is there a default HTML template I can use?,"Yes, Frappe provides a basic HTML template in `frappe/templates/base_template.html`."
You are a Frappe Framework expert.,I see there's a 'Route' setting for pages. What does that mean?,"The 'Route' setting determines the URL path for your page. For example, if you set the 'Route' to 'docs/', your page will be accessible at `yourwebsite.com/docs`."
You are a Frappe Framework expert.,Can I hide a page from the sidebar menu?,"Yes, you can use the 'Hide on Sidebar' setting to prevent a page from appearing in the sidebar menu."
You are a Frappe Framework expert.,"I'm curious, where can I find more information about Frappe website development?",You can find more information about Frappe website development in the official documentation at [https://frappeframework.com/docs/user/en/guides/portal-development](https://frappeframework.com/docs/user/en/guides/portal-development).
You are a Frappe Framework expert.,How can I control the order of pages in my Frappe portal?,"You can control the order of pages in your Frappe portal by creating an `index.txt` file within your folder. This file should list the names of the pages (without extensions) in the order you want them to appear on the portal. For example, if you want the pages 'adding-pages', 'ordering', 'contents', 'context', and 'building' to appear in that order, your `index.txt` file would look like this:

```
adding-pages
ordering
contents
context
building

You are a Frappe Framework expert.,I'm looking at the documentation for 'Ordering' pages on the Frappe Framework. Could you explain what this 'index.txt' file actually does?,"The `index.txt` file acts as a blueprint for the order of pages within a specific folder in your Frappe portal.  Each line in the file represents a page within that folder, and the order of the lines dictates the order in which those pages will appear on the portal. It essentially tells Frappe how to arrange the pages within that folder, creating a consistent and organized navigation structure for your users."
You are a Frappe Framework expert.,Is there a way to modify the page order without directly editing the `index.txt` file?,"While the `index.txt` file is the core method for controlling page order, you can indirectly manage it through the Frappe interface. Within the 'Page Settings' of each page, you have options like 'Route' and 'Hide on Sidebar'.  Changing these settings might influence the page order, though it's not a direct manipulation of the `index.txt` file.  The most reliable and direct way to define the order is still through editing the `index.txt` file itself."
You are a Frappe Framework expert.,I'm looking to add new pages to my Frappe website. Can you tell me how to do that?,"Absolutely! To add pages in Frappe, you need to create `.html` or `.md` files within the `www` folder.  The content should be placed directly within these files, without any `and` tags. You can also create pages using Markdown."
You are a Frappe Framework expert.,I'm a bit confused about the folder structure. Can you explain how to organize my files?,"Sure! The first file in a folder should be named `index.md` or `index.html`. This ensures the system recognizes the folder as a valid location for building pages.  So, if you want a page for `/home`, you would create a `home` folder within the `www` directory, and add an `index.html` or `index.md` file within it."
You are a Frappe Framework expert.,I want to add a link to another page on my website.  How do I do that within the markdown content?,"You can create links to other pages in your Frappe website using Markdown syntax. For example, if you want to link to a page called `/home/link`, you would use the following syntax:  `[link](/home/link)`. You don't need to include the `.html` extension in the link."
You are a Frappe Framework expert.,How can I control the page title?  I want to use a specific title instead of the filename.,"You have a few options. If you want to use a custom title, you can use the `<!-- title: Your Page Title -->` tag in your page's content.  Alternatively, you can use an `<h1>` tag. The text within the first `<h1>` block will be used as the page title if no custom title is specified. If neither of these options are used, the filename will be used as the title."
You are a Frappe Framework expert.,I'd like to add some custom styling to my page. Is that possible?,"Yes, you can add custom CSS styles.  Create a `.css` file with the same filename as your page (e.g., `index.css` for `index.md`).  This CSS file will be automatically applied to the page when it renders."
You are a Frappe Framework expert.,Can you explain those special tags you mentioned? What are they for?,"Certainly! Here's a breakdown of the special tags:

1. `<!-- jinja -->` : This tag tells Frappe to render the page using the Jinja templating engine.

2. `<!-- title: Your Page Title -->` :  This tag lets you define a custom title for the page.

3. `<!-- no-breadcrumbs -->`:  This tag prevents breadcrumbs from being displayed on the page.

4. `<!-- static -->`:  This tag enables caching for the page, which can be helpful if you're using Jinja templating."
You are a Frappe Framework expert.,Where can I find more detailed information about adding pages in Frappe?,You can find comprehensive documentation on the Frappe Framework website at [https://frappeframework.com/docs/user/en/guides/portal-development/adding-pages](https://frappeframework.com/docs/user/en/guides/portal-development/adding-pages). This documentation provides in-depth explanations and examples for adding pages and customizing your Frappe website.
You are a Frappe Framework expert.,How do I add a table of contents to a Frappe document?,"You can add a table of contents to your Frappe documents by adding the `{index}` string on a new line. This will render a numbered list of pages, but it only works in `index.md` or `index.html` files. You can also use `previous` and `next` within curly braces to create buttons for navigating between pages."
You are a Frappe Framework expert.,I see the mention of 'Previous' and 'Next' buttons. Can you elaborate on how they function?,"The `previous` and `next` strings, when enclosed in curly braces, create buttons that allow users to navigate between different pages within your Frappe document. These buttons are automatically generated based on the order of the pages in your document."
You are a Frappe Framework expert.,Where can I find more information about these features? I'd like to explore the options for customizing table of contents and navigation.,You can find detailed information on customizing table of contents and navigation in the Frappe Framework documentation. The specific page you're referring to is titled 'Table of Contents' and can be found at [https://frappeframework.com/docs/user/en/guides/portal-development/table-of-contents](https://frappeframework.com/docs/user/en/guides/portal-development/table-of-contents). This page provides a comprehensive guide with examples and explanations.
You are a Frappe Framework expert.,How can I create dynamic pages in Frappe?,"You can create dynamic pages in Frappe using the Jinja templating language. You can update the `context` object that you pass to the template to query data.  To do this, you'll create a `.py` file with the same name as your page (e.g., `index.py` for `index.md`). This file should contain a `get_context` method."
You are a Frappe Framework expert.,Can you give me an example of creating a dynamic page that displays a list of users?,"Sure! Let's say you want to display a list of users. You would create two files: `users.html` and `users.py` in the `www/` folder.  In `users.py`, you'd write a `get_context` function that retrieves the first and last names of all users using the `frappe.get_list` method.  Then, in `users.html`, you would use the Jinja templating language to loop through the retrieved user data and display it in an ordered list."
You are a Frappe Framework expert.,Can you provide me with code snippets for both the `users.py` and `users.html` files?,"Absolutely! Here's the code for `users.py`:

```python
import frappe
def get_context(context):
    context.users = frappe.get_list(""User"", fields=[""first_name"", ""last_name""])
```

And here's the code for `users.html`:

```html
<h3>List of Users</h3>
<ol>
{% for user in users %}
    <li>{{ user.first_name }} {{ user.get(""last_name"", """") }}</li>
{% endfor %}
</ol>
```"
You are a Frappe Framework expert.,I'm interested in learning more about how dynamic pages fit into the overall documentation of Frappe Framework.  Could you tell me where I can find more information?,"You can find detailed information about dynamic pages, including their implementation and examples, in the Frappe Framework documentation at [https://frappeframework.com/docs/user/en/guides/portal-development/context](https://frappeframework.com/docs/user/en/guides/portal-development/context)."
"You are an expert on the Frappe Framework, particularly in the area of Portal Roles.",Can you explain what Portal Roles are in Frappe?,"Portal Roles are a powerful feature in Frappe that allow you to control access to different sections of your website portal. By assigning roles to users, you can determine which parts of the portal they can see and interact with. This is especially useful for creating a more tailored user experience, such as providing specific information or functionalities to different groups."
"You are an expert on the Frappe Framework, particularly in the area of Portal Roles.",I'm interested in learning about how to set up default roles for users. Can you elaborate on that?,"You can define default roles that are automatically assigned to users based on specific criteria, such as their email address or data in a specific DocType. These rules are configured in the **Portal Settings** section of the Frappe interface. For example, if a user's email address matches a Contact record with a 'Customer' designation, you could automatically assign them the 'Customer' role."
"You are an expert on the Frappe Framework, particularly in the area of Portal Roles.",Could you provide an example of a default role rule using the code snippet provided in the documentation?,"Sure. Here's an example of a rule that would assign the 'Customer' role to a user based on their email address matching a Contact record with a 'customer' field filled in:

```python
{'role': 'Customer', 'doctype': 'Contact', 'email_field': 'email_id', 'filters': {'ifnull(customer, )': ('!=', '')}}
```

This rule specifies:

* `role`: The role to assign ('Customer' in this case).
* `doctype`: The DocType to check against (Contact).
* `email_field`: The field in the DocType to compare the user's email with ('email_id').
* `filters`: An additional condition to ensure the contact record has a customer value present (not null or empty)."
"You are an expert on the Frappe Framework, particularly in the area of Portal Roles.",I want to understand how to restrict access to specific menu items based on user roles. Can you explain that?,"You can control access to individual menu items on your portal by associating a role with each item. This means only users who have that specific role assigned will be able to see and interact with that menu item. This allows you to create customized user interfaces for different groups, ensuring they only see relevant content."
"You are an expert on the Frappe Framework, particularly in the area of Portal Roles.",Where can I find more detailed information about configuring Portal Roles in Frappe?,"The Frappe Framework documentation provides comprehensive information on setting up and managing Portal Roles. You can find it at this link: [https://frappeframework.com/docs/user/en/guides/portal-development/portal-roles](https://frappeframework.com/docs/user/en/guides/portal-development/portal-roles). This documentation covers various aspects of Portal Roles, including configuring default roles, assigning roles to users, and controlling access to menu items."
You are an expert on the Frappe Framework.,Can you tell me what web forms are in Frappe?,"Web Forms are a powerful feature in Frappe that allow you to add forms to your website. They are scriptable and offer features like tables, paging, and utilities. You can customize them to fit your specific needs."
You are an expert on the Frappe Framework.,I see the mention of 'Standard Web Forms'. What makes them special?,"Standard Web Forms are created when you check the 'Is Standard' checkbox. This creates a folder within the web form's module, containing `.py` and `.js` files. You can customize these files to tailor the web form to your specific requirements."
You are an expert on the Frappe Framework.,What kind of settings can I adjust for a web form?,"You can adjust several settings for web forms.  You can control whether users can edit, view, or edit multiple instances, show a grid view of data, and even allow users to save incomplete forms. These settings give you fine-grained control over how your web form functions."
You are an expert on the Frappe Framework.,Is it possible to add custom scripts to a web form?,"Yes, you can add custom client scripts to a web form. This feature was introduced in Version 11. These scripts let you add dynamic functionality and behavior to your forms."
You are an expert on the Frappe Framework.,I'm interested in the API you mentioned for web forms. What can I do with it?,"The API gives you a powerful way to interact with and manipulate web forms using JavaScript. You can write event handlers that trigger actions when fields change, get and set field values, add custom validation logic, and even modify field properties.  It lets you create very flexible and dynamic web forms."
You are an expert on the Frappe Framework.,Can you give me some examples of how to use the API to customize web forms?,"Absolutely! Here are some examples from the documentation:

* **Resetting a value if it's invalid:** You can use the `frappe.web_form.on()` function to trigger a script when a field's value changes. For example, you can check if an 'amount' field is less than 1000 and reset the field to 0 if it is.

* **Custom validation:** The `frappe.web_form.validate()` function lets you add your own validation logic before the form is saved. You could use it to check if an 'amount' field is greater than 1000 and prevent saving if it's not.

* **Hiding a field based on a value:**  You can use `frappe.web_form.set_df_property()` to dynamically hide or show fields based on the values of other fields. For example, you might hide a 'rate' field if the 'amount' is less than 1000.

* **Showing a message on startup:** The `frappe.web_form.after_load()` function lets you execute code after the form has loaded. You could use it to display a welcome message to the user."
You are an expert on the Frappe Framework.,"That's really helpful! One last thing, how can I customize the breadcrumbs for a web form?","You can customize the breadcrumbs in a web form by providing a JSON object. This object specifies the label and route for each breadcrumb. For example, you can create a breadcrumb with the label 'Home' and route '/' to link back to the homepage of your website."
You are an expert on the Frappe Framework.,What are generators in Frappe?,"Generators in Frappe allow you to turn Frappe DocTypes into web pages, making it easy to create a website using your Frappe data. You can use generators to display information about your products, services, team members, or anything else you want to share with the world."
You are an expert on the Frappe Framework.,Can you give me a step-by-step guide on setting up a generator?,"Absolutely! Here's a detailed breakdown of the steps involved in setting up a generator in Frappe:

1. **Add a 'route' field**: This field specifies the URL path for your web page, and is mandatory. 
2. **Add a condition field**: This field helps you control whether a page is viewable or not (for example, a 'published' field indicating whether the content should be displayed).
3. **Include the Doctype in 'website_generators'**: You need to add the Doctype name to the `website_generators` list in the `hooks.py` file of your app.
4. **Subclass the controller**: Create a class that subclasses `frappe.website.website_generator.WebsiteGenerator`.
5. **Create a template**: Design the layout of your webpage using a template file (e.g., `job_opening.html` for a Job Opening page). 
6. **Add custom properties (context)**: Define additional context variables that will be available to the template. 
7. **Customize route and list view (optional)**: You can customize the route and how the data is displayed in list views using additional methods."
You are an expert on the Frappe Framework.,I'm creating a generator for a 'Job Opening' DocType. How do I add breadcrumbs in the template?,"You can use the `context.parents` property in the `get_context` method of your controller class to add breadcrumbs.  In your 'JobOpening' controller, you would define the breadcrumbs as a list of dictionaries, each with a 'name' and 'title' key. The 'name' value will be used to link the breadcrumb, and the 'title' will be displayed. 

Here's an example of how you might add breadcrumbs for the 'Job Opening' generator: 

```python
from frappe.website.website_generator import WebsiteGenerator
from frappe import _

class JobOpening(WebsiteGenerator):
    # ... your website properties

    def get_context(self, context):
        context.parents = [{'name': 'jobs', 'title': _('All Jobs') }]
        # ... any other context variables
```

This will add a breadcrumb titled 'All Jobs' that links to the `/jobs` route."
You are an expert on the Frappe Framework.,Where can I find more information about the Frappe Framework and generators?,"You can find a wealth of information about Frappe and generators on the official Frappe Framework website. You can find documentation on generators, as well as other aspects of the framework, at this URL: [https://frappeframework.com/docs/user/en/guides/portal-development/generators](https://frappeframework.com/docs/user/en/guides/portal-development/generators). Additionally, Frappe's community forum is a great place to ask questions and get support from other developers."
You are a Frappe Framework expert.,How do I set up redirects in a Frappe website?,"You can set up redirects by adding the `website_redirects` hook. This hook allows you to specify source URLs and their corresponding target URLs. For example, you can redirect `/from` to `https://mysite/from` or `/from` to `/main`. You can even use regular expressions to create more complex redirects."
You are a Frappe Framework expert.,What are the different types of redirects I can use in Frappe?,"You can use absolute or relative URLs as targets for your redirects. You can also use regular expressions to match parts of the source URL and dynamically construct the target URL. For example, you could redirect any URL matching `/from/(.*)` to `/main/`, where `` represents the captured group from the regular expression."
You are a Frappe Framework expert.,Can I control the HTTP status code for redirects?,"Yes, you can specify the `redirect_http_status` field to control the HTTP status code used for the redirect. If you don't specify this field, the default status code will be 301 (Moved Permanently). You can use other codes like 302 (Found), 307 (Temporary Redirect) or 308 (Permanent Redirect) depending on your needs."
You are a Frappe Framework expert.,Where can I find more information about redirects in the Frappe documentation?,You can find more information about redirects in the Frappe documentation at https://frappeframework.com/docs/user/en/guides/portal-development/redirects. This documentation covers the `website_redirects` hook and provides additional examples of different types of redirects.
You are an expert in the Frappe Framework and its Data Migration Tool.,What is the Data Migration Tool in Frappe Framework?,"The Data Migration Tool in Frappe Framework is a powerful feature that simplifies the process of syncing data between a remote source and a DocType within your Frappe-based application. It acts as a bridge between your Frappe website and external data sources, allowing you to seamlessly manage data transfer and updates."
You are an expert in the Frappe Framework and its Data Migration Tool.,Can you explain the concept of a Data Migration Plan?,A Data Migration Plan is essentially a blueprint for your data migration process. It defines a set of mappings that specify how data should be transferred between the remote source and your local DocType. Think of it as a roadmap outlining the exact rules for data synchronization.
You are an expert in the Frappe Framework and its Data Migration Tool.,"What is a Data Migration Mapping, and what are its key components?","A Data Migration Mapping defines the specific rules for field-to-field mapping between your remote data source and your local DocType. It's like a detailed instruction manual that tells the tool how to connect corresponding fields. 

Here are the key components of a Data Migration Mapping:

1. **Remote Objectname**: The name of the object in your remote data source.
2. **Remote Primary Key**: The primary key field that uniquely identifies records in the remote object.
3. **Local DocType**: The DocType in your Frappe application that you want to sync the data with.
4. **Mapping Type**:  This determines the direction of data transfer, either 'Push' (from local to remote), 'Pull' (from remote to local), or 'Sync' (both ways).
5. **Page Length**: This specifies the batch size for the sync operation, controlling how many records are processed at once."
You are an expert in the Frappe Framework and its Data Migration Tool.,How can I customize field mappings beyond simple field name associations?,"You can achieve more complex field mappings by using literal values in quotes and `eval` statements. For example, if you need to map a local field to a specific string value or an evaluated expression, you can directly specify that in the mapping. However, keep in mind that this approach is not applicable for `Sync` mappings, as both local and remote field names need to serve as destinations."
You are an expert in the Frappe Framework and its Data Migration Tool.,Can you explain the concept of pre and post process methods in data migration mappings?,"Pre and post process methods provide you with additional control over the data migration process. They allow you to execute custom logic before and after the actual field mapping takes place. The `pre_process` method receives the source document, allowing you to modify or manipulate the data before it's mapped. On the other hand, the `post_process` method receives both the source and target documents, giving you a chance to perform actions after the mapping is complete, like data validation or further transformations."
You are an expert in the Frappe Framework and its Data Migration Tool.,Where are these pre and post process methods defined within the Frappe Framework?,"When you add a Data Migration Mapping to a Plan, Frappe automatically generates a mapping module in the directory specified in your Plan. This module contains the pre and post process methods you can customize. For example, if your Data Migration Plan is named 'Atlas Sync', you'll find the module in the 'Integrations' directory under the `data_migration_mapping` folder."
You are an expert in the Frappe Framework and its Data Migration Tool.,How do I establish a connection to my remote data source?,"To connect to your remote data source, you need to create a Data Migration Connector. The Connector serves as the bridge between your Frappe application and the external system. You can specify the Connector Type, hostname, username, and password for authentication. For example, if you're connecting to an Atlas instance, you would create an Atlas Connector."
You are an expert in the Frappe Framework and its Data Migration Tool.,Where do I write the code for my custom connector?,"Create a new Python file within the `frappe/data_migration/doctype/data_migration_connector/connectors/` directory. The name of the file should correspond to your Connector Type. For instance, if you're creating an Atlas Connector, the file would be named `atlas_connection.py`. Within this file, you need to implement the `insert`, `update`, and `delete` methods to handle data operations. Additionally, write the connection logic to establish a connection to your remote instance in the `__init__` method."
You are an expert in the Frappe Framework and its Data Migration Tool.,"After creating the Connector file, what other steps are required?",You need to import your newly created connector file into the `data_migration_connector.py` file. This ensures that Frappe can recognize and use your custom connector.
You are an expert in the Frappe Framework and its Data Migration Tool.,What is the purpose of a Data Migration Run?,"A Data Migration Run brings everything together. It takes your Data Migration Plan and Data Migration Connector as inputs and executes the data migration process according to your configuration. It handles tasks like queuing, batching, delta updates, and more, ensuring efficient and reliable data transfer."
You are an expert in the Frappe Framework and its Data Migration Tool.,How does the Data Migration Run handle efficiency and updates?,"The Data Migration Run is designed to be efficient. When you execute a run, it only processes records that have been changed or failed in the previous run. This means that subsequent runs focus on updates and synchronization, minimizing redundant data transfers. You can view the progress in real-time as the run executes."
You are an expert in the Frappe Framework and its Data Migration Tool.,Where can I find more information about the Data Migration Tool and report issues?,"The Data Migration Tool is still in beta, so you might encounter some issues. For more information or to report any problems, you can visit the official documentation for the Frappe Framework at [https://frappeframework.com/docs/user/en/guides/data/using-data-migration-tool](https://frappeframework.com/docs/user/en/guides/data/using-data-migration-tool) or submit an issue on the Frappe GitHub repository: [https://github.com/frappe/erpnext/issues](https://github.com/frappe/erpnext/issues)."

You are an expert on the Frappe Framework.,"I'm trying to import a CSV file, but it's giving me errors. How can I troubleshoot the issue?","The `bench import-csv` command has a few helpful options that can assist with troubleshooting. For example, you can use `--ignore-encoding-errors` to skip encoding errors during conversion to Unicode, which might be causing problems. You can also use `--help` to see all available options and their descriptions."
You are an expert on the Frappe Framework.,I want to import a CSV file without overwriting existing data. Is that possible?,"Yes, you can use the `--only-insert` option with the `bench import-csv` command. This will only insert new records from the CSV file and will not overwrite any existing records in your Frappe database."
You are an expert on the Frappe Framework.,"After importing a CSV file, I want the document to be automatically submitted. Is there a way to do this?","Yes, you can use the `--submit-after-import` option with the `bench import-csv` command. This will automatically submit the imported document after the CSV file is imported."
You are an expert on the Frappe Framework.,Can you give me an example of how to use the `bench import-csv` command to import a CSV file?,Here's an example: `bench --site test.erpnext.com import-csv ~/Downloads/Activity_Type.csv`.  This command will import the CSV file `Activity_Type.csv` from your Downloads folder into your Frappe site `test.erpnext.com`. 
"You are an expert on the Frappe Framework, specifically its integration with Google GSuite.",I'm interested in using Google Docs as templates within Frappe. Can you explain how this works?,Absolutely! Frappe lets you use Google Docs as templates to generate new GSuite documents. You can populate them with data from your Frappe DocTypes using Jinja2 formatting. These generated documents will be attached to the relevant DocType within Frappe. It's a fantastic way to automate document creation based on your data.
"You are an expert on the Frappe Framework, specifically its integration with Google GSuite.","Before I start using Google Docs as templates, what steps do I need to take to enable the Google GSuite integration within Frappe?","You'll need to go through a few steps to enable the integration. First, you'll need to publish a Google Apps Script. This script is available in the 'Explore > Integrations > GSuite Settings' section of your Frappe instance. You'll then need to get Google access by enabling the Google Drive API in the Google Cloud Console.

You are a Frappe Framework expert.,What is token-based authentication in Frappe?,"Token-based authentication is a security method used in Frappe to verify the identity of users accessing the server. It's a more modern approach compared to session cookies, and it helps improve server performance."
You are a Frappe Framework expert.,How does token-based authentication work in Frappe?,"Instead of relying on session IDs stored on the server, token-based authentication in Frappe uses unique tokens. When a user successfully logs in, a token is generated and sent back to the client. This token is then included in every subsequent request made by the user. The server validates the token to authenticate the user's identity."
You are a Frappe Framework expert.,What are the advantages of using token-based authentication in Frappe?,"Token-based authentication offers several advantages: 

- **Improved Security:** Tokens are more secure than session IDs because they don't rely on server-side storage, reducing the risk of session hijacking.
- **Reduced Server Load:** Tokens eliminate the need for session management on the server, leading to lower server load.
- **Scalability:** Token-based authentication is well-suited for scaling applications as it doesn't require maintaining session state on each server."
You are a Frappe Framework expert.,How do I generate an API key and API secret in Frappe?,"You can generate an API key and API secret for a user in Frappe using several methods:

- **Web Interface:** Navigate to the 'User' section, then click on 'Api Access' and select 'Generate Keys'.
- **Command Line:** Use the command `bench execute frappe.core.doctype.user.user --args ['user_name']`
- **Remote Procedure Call (RPC):** Send a request to the endpoint `/api/method/frappe.core.doctype.user.user?user=""user_name""`."
You are a Frappe Framework expert.,What are the limitations of token-based authentication in Frappe?,"While token-based authentication is generally considered more secure and efficient, it has some limitations:

- **Token Management:** You need to manage token expiration and revocation to prevent unauthorized access.
- **Token Size:** Tokens can be relatively large, potentially affecting performance for large datasets.
- **Security Concerns:** If tokens are compromised, it can lead to unauthorized access, so proper security measures are crucial."
You are a Frappe Framework expert.,Can I regenerate an API key in Frappe?,"No, once an API key is generated in Frappe, it cannot be regenerated. This is a security measure to prevent unauthorized access."
You are a Frappe Framework expert.,Who can generate API keys in Frappe?,Only users with the 'System Manager' role in Frappe can generate API keys. This ensures that API keys are only created by authorized personnel.
You are a Frappe Framework expert.,Where can I find more information about using tokens for API requests in Frappe?,You can find detailed information about using tokens for API requests in the Frappe documentation. The specific guide you are looking for is located at [https://frappeframework.com/docs/user/en/guides/integration/how_to_setup_token_based_auth](https://frappeframework.com/docs/user/en/guides/integration/how_to_setup_token_based_auth). This guide provides step-by-step instructions on how to use tokens to authenticate your API requests.
You are a Frappe Framework expert.,Can you explain how OpenID Connect works with Frappe's social login?,"Frappe uses OpenID Connect, a standard for user authentication, to enable social login. It allows users to log in to your Frappe application using their existing accounts from other services, like Google or Facebook. This process involves a primary server, which acts as the Identity Provider (IDP) and manages all users, and an app server which acts as the client connecting to the IDP. When you click the social login icon on your app server, you're redirected to the IDP for authentication. After confirming access, you're returned to the app server, logged in with the ID from the IDP. You can find more detailed information about setting up social login with Frappe on this page: [https://frappeframework.com/docs/user/en/guides/integration/openid_connect_and_frappe_social_login](https://frappeframework.com/docs/user/en/guides/integration/openid_connect_and_frappe_social_login)"
You are a Frappe Framework expert.,What is the purpose of the `id_token` in OpenID Connect?,"The `id_token` is a JSON Web Token (JWT) that contains information about the authenticated user. It's issued by the Identity Provider (IDP) and sent to the app server as part of the authorization response. It's signed with `HS256` and the client secret, ensuring its authenticity. The `id_token` includes the user's unique identifier (sub), expiration time (exp), and a hash of the access token (at_hash) to prevent token substitution attacks."
You are a Frappe Framework expert.,How do I set up a primary server for Frappe social login?,"To set up a primary server, which acts as the Identity Provider (IDP) for Frappe social login, you need to access the _Setup_ > _Integrations_ > _Social Login Keys_ section in your Frappe instance. Here, you'll enter the URL of your main server, for example, `https://frappe.io`. This URL should be consistent across all Frappe servers that connect to this primary server for authentication. You can then add as many OAuth clients as required, depending on the number of app servers you're connecting.  Remember to disable the 'Skip Authorization' option unless you're dealing with internal apps within a single organization and need a seamless user experience."
You are a Frappe Framework expert.,What if I need to use social login for an app that's internal to my organization?,"For internal applications, you can check the 'Skip Authorization' option during OAuth client registration. This will streamline the user experience by removing the step where users need to explicitly allow or deny access to resources. This is particularly useful when you want a seamless flow for users within your organization."
You are a Frappe Framework expert.,I'm having trouble logging in to my Frappe app using my social account. What could be the issue?,"There are a few things to check if you're having trouble logging in with your social account. First, ensure you have correctly configured the `Frappe Client ID` and `Frappe Client Secret` on the app server, referencing the client you created on the primary server. Make sure you're using the correct URL for the `Frappe Server URL`, which should be the main server where your organization's identities are stored. If you've checked these settings and are still facing issues, you might need to verify your social login settings on the Identity Provider (IDP) side, ensuring that the necessary applications are properly authorized."
You are a Frappe Framework expert.,What are Webhooks in Frappe?,"Webhooks in Frappe are user-defined HTTP callbacks. They allow you to trigger actions on other systems or applications based on specific events happening within a Frappe DocType.  You can configure a webhook to send data whenever a specific event occurs in a DocType, like when a document is created, updated, or submitted. This data is sent as an HTTP request to a URL you specify, enabling seamless integration with other systems."
You are a Frappe Framework expert.,How do I configure a Webhook?,"To configure a Webhook, you go to **Integrations > Webhook > Webhook** in your Frappe instance.  You'll then need to provide these details:

1. **DocType**: Select the DocType where you want to trigger the webhook (e.g., Quotation).
2. **Doc Event**:  Choose the event that will trigger the webhook (e.g., on_update).
3. **Conditions (Optional)**: Define specific conditions for triggering the webhook, if needed.
4. **Request URL**: Enter the valid URL that will receive the webhook data.
5. **Request Method**: Select the HTTP method, with POST being the default.
6. **Headers (Optional)**: Add any necessary headers for the request, like an API key.

You can disable a webhook by unchecking the 'Enabled' checkbox."
You are a Frappe Framework expert.,Can you explain the different data structures for webhook requests?,"Sure.  Frappe supports two data structures for webhook requests:

1. **Form URL-Encoded**:  This structure sends data as key-value pairs, like a standard HTML form submission.  You can map Frappe document fields to these key-value pairs. For example, you could send 'name' as the 'id' key.

2. **JSON**: You can use Jinja templating to create JSON data structures for your webhook requests.  This provides more flexibility to customize the data format. Make sure to wrap fields in double quotes when using Jinja templating.

The example in the documentation shows a JSON structure for a Quotation update, where fields like 'lineItems' and 'id' are included in the JSON payload."
You are a Frappe Framework expert.,How does Webhook Security work?,"Webhook security in Frappe is designed to ensure the integrity and authenticity of webhook requests.  You can optionally set up a 'Webhook Secret' when configuring a webhook.  This secret is used to generate a unique signature for each request, adding an `X-Frappe-Webhook-Signature` header.  This header value is a base64-encoded HMAC-SHA256 hash of the payload, generated using the secret key.  This process helps verify that the request is originating from Frappe and hasn't been tampered with.  It's crucial not to share this secret publicly to maintain security."
You are a Frappe Framework expert.,Where can I see the logs of successful webhook requests?,"Frappe automatically generates a webhook request log for every successful request.  You can find these logs by navigating to **Integrations > Webhook > Webhook Request Log**. The logs contain important details about the request, including the timestamp, DocType, event, request URL, and the data sent. This log helps you track and troubleshoot your webhook integrations."
You are a Frappe Framework expert.,I want to integrate my Frappe instance with an external application using webhooks. Can you give me an example scenario?,"Sure. Let's say you have an e-commerce platform built using Frappe, and you want to automatically update customer addresses in your CRM system whenever an order is placed.  Here's how you could do it using webhooks:

1. **Configure Webhook in Frappe**: You would set up a webhook for the 'Order' DocType in Frappe, triggering on the 'on_submit' event. This means that whenever an order is submitted, the webhook will send data to your CRM system.

2. **Set up Request URL**:  You'll need to configure the Request URL to point to the endpoint in your CRM system that handles address updates. 

3. **Data Mapping**:  In the webhook configuration, you'd map the relevant fields from the Order DocType (like customer name and address details) to the fields expected by your CRM system's update API. 

4. **CRM Endpoint**: The endpoint in your CRM system would receive the data sent by the webhook, process it, and update the customer's address.  

This way, whenever an order is placed and submitted in your Frappe e-commerce platform, the webhook will automatically update the corresponding customer's address in your CRM system, maintaining data consistency between your applications."
You are a Frappe Framework expert.,I'm looking to enable social login for my Frappe application. Can you tell me how to do it?,"Absolutely! You can add social login providers like Facebook, Frappe, Github, Google, Microsoft, etc., to your Frappe application. To enable social login, you need to go to **Integrations > Authentication > Social Login Key**.  From there, you'll be able to configure the settings for each social provider you want to use.  "
You are a Frappe Framework expert.,I'm confused about the "Social Login Key" section.  Can you explain what the different options mean?,"Of course! The Social Login Key section is where you set up each social login provider. Here's a breakdown of the options:

1. **Social Login Provider:** Select the provider you want to use (Facebook, Google, Github, etc.). You can also choose ""Custom"" for other providers.
2. **Base URL:** This is required for some providers and allows the provider to communicate with your Frappe application. 
3. **Enable Social Login:** Check this box to activate the social login icon on your login screen.
4. **Client ID and Client Secret:** You'll need to obtain these from the provider's developer console. They are unique identifiers that allow your Frappe application to connect to the provider."
You are a Frappe Framework expert.,Where can I find the Client ID and Client Secret for Google?,You can get your Client ID and Client Secret by creating a Google API Console project. You can find instructions on how to do this here: [https://developers.google.com/identity/sign-in/web/devconsole-project](https://developers.google.com/identity/sign-in/web/devconsole-project).

This guide will walk you through the process of obtaining your Client ID and Client Secret, setting up the login flow, and configuring your Frappe application to accept Facebook logins."
You are a Frappe Framework expert.,I'm looking for more information about the social login process for Github.,"To add Github login to your Frappe application, you'll need to create an OAuth App on the Github platform.  You can find instructions on how to do this here: [https://developer.github.com/apps/building-oauth-apps/creating-an-oauth-app/](https://developer.github.com/apps/building-oauth-apps/creating-an-oauth-app/).  Once you've created the app, you'll have your Client ID and Client Secret, which you can then enter into your Frappe application's Social Login Key settings."
You are a Frappe Framework expert.,Can you tell me how to integrate Google Calendar with Frappe?,"Sure! Frappe provides an integration with Google Calendar allowing users to synchronize their events. To set it up, you need to connect to your application in Google Cloud Platform and create an account for each user. This involves creating a new project in Google Cloud Platform, generating OAuth 2.0 credentials, adding your site to authorized JavaScript origins, adding a redirect URI, and finally, adding your Client ID and Client Secret in the Gcalendar application within Frappe. After successful setup, each user can create their own account within the Google Calendar integration in Frappe. You can find more detailed instructions on the Frappe documentation page [https://frappeframework.com/docs/user/en/guides/integration/google_calendar](https://frappeframework.com/docs/user/en/guides/integration/google_calendar)."
You are a Frappe Framework expert.,What kind of events are synchronized between Frappe and Google Calendar?,"The synchronization covers both creating and updating events in both directions. Events created in Frappe are also created in Google Calendar, and vice versa.  Additionally, recurring events are supported, and modifications or deletions in Frappe are reflected in Google Calendar and vice versa."
You are a Frappe Framework expert.,Are there any limitations to the Google Calendar integration?,"Currently, there's one limitation. If you cancel an instance of a recurring event in Google Calendar, this change won't be reflected in Frappe. However, the integration follows Frappe's authorization rules, ensuring that only public events or events owned by the user are synchronized."
You are a Frappe Framework expert.,I'm interested in the features of this integration. What are the main benefits of using it?,"The integration offers several benefits. You can create a new dedicated calendar in Google Calendar for each user, making it easy to manage their individual events.  Events created in Frappe are automatically synchronized to Google Calendar, ensuring consistency and eliminating the need for manual entries. Additionally, you can add a Google Meet conference link to an event and invite participants by their email addresses, streamlining collaboration."
You are a Frappe Framework expert.,Can you explain what OAuth 2.0 is and how it's used in Frappe?,"OAuth 2.0 is an open standard protocol for authorization that allows third-party applications to access protected resources on behalf of a user without sharing their credentials. In Frappe, OAuth 2.0 enables you to connect your Frappe applications with other apps by providing a secure and controlled way to share data. It's built into Frappe using the oauthlib library, so you can easily integrate your Frappe apps with other services."
You are a Frappe Framework expert.,What are the four roles defined in OAuth 2.0?,"OAuth 2.0 defines four roles:

1. **Resource Owner:** This is the entity (often a person) who owns the data being accessed. They grant access to their resources.
2. **Resource Server:** This is the server where the protected resources are stored and managed. It receives and responds to requests with access tokens.
3. **Client:** This is the application that wants to access the protected resources. It acts on behalf of the resource owner with their authorization.
4. **Authorization Server:** This server issues access tokens to the client after verifying the resource owner's identity and authorization."
You are a Frappe Framework expert.,How do I set up an OAuth 2.0 Provider in Frappe?,"To set up an OAuth 2.0 Provider in Frappe, follow these steps:

1. **Navigate to OAuth Provider Settings:** Go to **Setup > Integrations > OAuth Provider Settings**.
2. **Configure Confirmation Message:** You can choose between `Force` and `Auto` for confirmation messages. `Force` requires user confirmation every time, while `Auto` only asks for confirmation if there are no active tokens for the user.
3. **Add Primary Server:** This is the main server hosting your users.  For example, `https://frappe.io`.  Add a new `Frappe Social Login Key` in **Setup > Integrations > Social Login Key**, setting the `Base URL` to your main server. This will be the main Identity Provider (IDP). 
4. **Add OAuth Clients:** Under your primary server, add as many `OAuth Clients` as needed for different applications that will connect to your Frappe instance."
You are a Frappe Framework expert.,How do I add a Client App for my application in Frappe?,"To add a client app to your Frappe instance, follow these steps:

1. **Go to OAuth Client:** Navigate to **Setup > Integrations > OAuth Client**.
2. **Provide App Details:** Fill in the following information:
  - **App Name:** Give your client app a name (e.g., CAVS).
  - **Skip Authorization:**  Check this if you want to treat the client as trusted and skip the confirmation message during authentication.
  - **Scopes:**  List the scopes you want to request from users when authorizing your application. Separate scopes with spaces.
  - **Redirect URIs:** Specify the URLs where the user will be redirected after authentication. Separate multiple URLs with spaces.
  - **Default Redirect URIs:** Select the default redirect URI from your list of Redirect URIs.
  - **Grant Type:** Choose `Authorization Code` or `Implicit` based on your application's requirements.
  - **Response Type:** Select `Code` for `Authorization Code` grant type or `Token` for `Implicit` grant type."
You are a Frappe Framework expert.,I'm interested in learning more about how to actually use OAuth 2.0 in my application. Where can I find more information?,You can find more detailed information on using OAuth 2.0 in your Frappe applications within the Frappe Framework documentation. You can also refer to the Frappe API documentation for specific guidance on how to integrate OAuth 2.0 into your code.
You are a Frappe Framework expert.,What is token-based authentication?,"Token-based authentication is a security technique used to authenticate users accessing a server. It involves validating a security token, which is generated and sent to the user after successful login, to verify their identity and authorize access to resources."
You are a Frappe Framework expert.,How does token-based authentication work in Frappe?,"In Frappe, token-based authentication replaces traditional session cookies. Instead of storing session IDs server-side, it utilizes tokens. This reduces server load and improves security. A user's identity is confirmed through a combination of an API key and an API secret, which together form a unique token. This token is used to authenticate both RPC and REST API requests, allowing users to access resources with specific permissions."
You are a Frappe Framework expert.,How can I generate a token in Frappe?,"You can generate an API key and API secret for each user, which together form a token, in Frappe using the web interface, command line, or remote procedure call (RPC). To generate keys through the web interface, navigate to `User -> Api Access -> Generate Keys`. You can also generate keys via RPC using the command `/api/method/frappe.core.doctype.user.user.generate_keys?user=""user_name""` or through the command line using `bench execute frappe.core.doctype.user.user.generate_keys --args ['user_name']`. Remember that only users with the System Manager role can generate keys, and API keys cannot be re-generated once created."
You are a Frappe Framework expert.,Where can I find more information about using tokens in API requests?,"You can find detailed instructions on how to use tokens in API requests in the Frappe documentation. Specifically, check out the section `Guides / Integrations / Rest Api / Token Based Authentication` on the Frappe website: [https://frappeframework.com/docs/user/en/guides/integration/how_to_set_up_token_based_auth](https://frappeframework.com/docs/user/en/guides/integration/how_to_set_up_token_based_auth)."
You are a Frappe framework expert.,What is Frappe Framework?,"Frappe Framework is a low-code, Python, and JavaScript web framework designed for building web applications.

You can choose from installing it manually using the provided documentation for Debian-based systems, using Docker for a streamlined approach, or the easiest option, using Frappe Cloud to spin up a new site with the framework already installed."
You are a Frappe framework expert.,Can I use Frappe Framework to authenticate third-party applications?,"Yes, Frappe Framework provides a robust mechanism for authenticating third-party applications using OAuth. This guide, titled 'Using Frappe as OAuth Service,' details how to set up Grafana server and integrate it with Frappe Framework for authentication. You can find more information on the reference URL: https://frappeframework.com/docs/user/en/using_frappe_as_oauth_service"
You are a Frappe framework expert.,How do I configure Frappe for OAuth?,"Once you've logged into your Frappe site, you need to create a new entry in the 'OAuth Client' doctype. You can access this doctype using the awesomebar (Ctrl+G) and searching for 'OAuth Client'. From the dropdown, select 'New OAuth Client'. You'll then configure the App Name, Open ID scopes, and Redirect URIs.  The redirect URI for Grafana is found in their documentation and typically looks like `<grafana-url>/login/generic_oauth`.  Once you've saved your settings, you'll receive an App Client ID and App Client Secret. These are needed for the Grafana configuration."
You are a Frappe framework expert.,What are the steps for configuring Grafana for OAuth?,"You will need to edit the `grafana.ini` file located in the `/etc/grafana` folder on a Debian/Ubuntu system.  Within this file, edit the `[auth.generic_oauth]` section. You'll need to uncomment the lines and fill in the required data, including the Client ID and Client Secret you received from your Frappe site, the scopes, and the various URLs (auth_url, token_url, and api_url). If you're using a reverse proxy, you'll also need to add the domain name of your Grafana server in the `server` section of the `grafana.ini` file. Finally, save the file and restart the Grafana service using `sudo systemctl restart grafana-server.service` to apply the changes."
You are a Frappe framework expert.,What is Grafana?,Grafana is a powerful metrics visualization platform created by Grafana Labs. It allows you to generate interactive graphs and dashboards from data and can be used for alerting.

You are a Frappe Framework expert.,What is the base URL for the Frappe API?,"The base URL for the Frappe API is `https://{your frappe instance}`. So, if your Frappe instance is `demo.erpnext.com`, the base URL would be `https://demo.erpnext.com`."
You are a Frappe Framework expert.,Can you explain the difference between RPC and REST in the Frappe API?,"Frappe API uses two main types of API calls: RPC (Remote Procedure Calls) and REST (Representational State Transfer). 

RPC is used to call whitelisted Python functions within your Frappe instance. You use the endpoint `/api/method/dotted.path.to.function` to access these functions. 

REST is used for manipulating resources (documents) within Frappe. It utilizes the `/api/resource/` prefix for all CRUD operations on documents."
You are a Frappe Framework expert.,How do I retrieve a specific document using the REST API?,"You can retrieve a specific document by its name using the endpoint `/api/resource/{doctype}/{name}`. For example, to get a document named 'My Document' from the 'ToDo' doctype, you would use the following URL: `https://{your frappe instance}/api/resource/ToDo/My%20Document`"
You are a Frappe Framework expert.,I want to create a new document using the REST API. How do I do that?,"You can create a new document by sending a `POST` request to the endpoint `/api/resource/{doctype}` with the document data in the request body. For instance, to create a new 'ToDo' document, you would send a `POST` request to `https://{your frappe instance}/api/resource/ToDo` with the necessary data in the request body."
You are a Frappe Framework expert.,What's the difference between using `PUT` and `PATCH` for updating a document?,"While both `PUT` and `PATCH` are used for updating documents, `PUT` requires sending the entire updated document, while `PATCH` allows you to send only the specific fields you want to change.  This makes `PATCH` more efficient for partial updates. The Frappe REST API's `PUT` endpoint essentially functions like a `PATCH` request, allowing you to update only the fields you specify."
You are a Frappe Framework expert.,I'm interested in learning more about authentication with the Frappe API. Can you point me to some resources?,"You can find more information on authentication methods for the Frappe API, including token-based authentication, simple authentication, and OAuth2, in the documentation here: [https://frappeframework.com/docs/user/en/guides/integration/rest_api](https://frappeframework.com/docs/user/en/guides/integration/rest_api). This document covers different authentication approaches and provides code examples for implementing them."
You are a Frappe Framework expert.,I'm trying to understand how authentication works in the Frappe REST API. Can you explain the login process?,"Sure! To log in using the Frappe REST API, you make a POST request to `/api/method/login` with the username and password in the body of the request. The request should have a 'Content-Type' header set to 'application/x-www-form-urlencoded'.  If successful, you'll receive a 200 HTTP code and a JSON response containing your home page, full name, and a 'message' confirming you're logged in. Most importantly, you'll also get a 'sid' cookie which is essential for authenticating all future requests. This cookie typically expires in three days. You can find more detailed information about this process in the Frappe documentation at [https://frappeframework.com/docs/user/en/guides/integration/rest_api/simple_authentication](https://frappeframework.com/docs/user/en/guides/integration/rest_api/simple_authentication)."
You are a Frappe Framework expert.,What happens if I provide incorrect credentials when logging in?,"If you provide incorrect credentials, the Frappe API will return a 401 HTTP code with a plain text response indicating 'Wrong password or username'."
You are a Frappe Framework expert.,"Once I'm logged in, how can I log out?","To log out, you send a GET request to `/api/method/logout`. This will clear your session and return a 200 HTTP code with an empty JSON response (`{}`). You'll no longer be authenticated after this."
You are a Frappe Framework expert.,Is there a way to get the ID of the currently logged in user?,"Yes, you can use the `/api/method/frappe.auth.get_logged_user` endpoint. This endpoint returns the ID of the currently authenticated user. For example, you would send a GET request to the endpoint, and it would return a 200 HTTP code and a JSON response containing the username, like 'Administrator'."
You are an expert on Frappe Framework's token-based authentication system.,I'm trying to understand how token-based authentication works in Frappe. Can you explain it to me?,"Sure! Token-based authentication in Frappe is a way to securely authenticate users making API requests to your Frappe server. It involves using an API key and API secret, which you can generate for specific users within your Frappe application.  These keys are then used in the HTTP Authorization header, which is sent with each API request."
You are an expert on Frappe Framework's token-based authentication system.,How do I generate the API key and API secret needed for token-based authentication?,"To generate API keys and secrets, you need to go to the User List in your Frappe application.  Select the user you want to grant API access to, then click on the 'Settings' tab. Look for the 'API Access' section and click 'Generate Keys'. This will open a popup where you can copy the generated API secret, which you should store securely.  The API key will also be displayed in this section."
You are an expert on Frappe Framework's token-based authentication system.,I've got my API key and API secret. How do I actually use them in an API request?,"You'll use your API key and secret in the Authorization header of your API request. The format is: `Authorization: token <api_key>:<api_secret>`.  For example, in Python using the requests library, you would set the header like this: `headers = {'Authorization': 'token <api_key>:<api_secret>'}`."
You are an expert on Frappe Framework's token-based authentication system.,Is there a way to use Basic authentication instead of token authentication in Frappe?,"Yes, Frappe also supports Basic authentication. In this method, you combine your API key and API secret with a colon, then base64 encode the resulting string. This encoded string is then added to the Authorization header as follows: `Authorization: Basic base64encode(<api_key>:<api_secret>)`.  Keep in mind that token authentication is generally considered more secure than Basic authentication."
You are an expert on Frappe Framework's token-based authentication system.,I'm familiar with OAuth 2.0.  Can I use it for authentication in Frappe as well?,"Yes, Frappe supports OAuth 2.0 authentication. You can set up OAuth 2.0 in your Frappe application and generate an access token.  This access token is then used in the Authorization header of your API requests in the format: `Authorization: Bearer access_token`. You can find more information on setting up OAuth 2.0 in the Frappe documentation under 'Guides / Integration / How To Use OAuth 2'."
"You are a Frappe Framework expert, specializing in OAuth 2.0 implementation.",I'm new to OAuth 2.0. Can you explain what it is and how it works with Frappe?,"OAuth 2.0 is an open standard for authorization, allowing users to grant limited access to their information without sharing their credentials. In the context of Frappe, it enables secure authentication for third-party applications to access ERPNext data on behalf of the user. Here's how it works:

1. **Authorization Request:** Your application initiates an authorization request to Frappe, providing details like your app's client ID, the scope of access needed, and the callback URI. This redirects the user to a Frappe authorization page.
2. **User Consent:** The user is presented with a prompt to grant your application permission to access their information. If they approve, they are redirected back to your application's callback URI.
3. **Authorization Code:** The callback URI receives an authorization code, which is a temporary token.
4. **Token Exchange:** You use the authorization code to request an access token from Frappe. This access token grants your application the authorized access.
5. **Authenticated Requests:** You can then use this access token to perform authenticated requests to ERPNext's API."
"You are a Frappe Framework expert, specializing in OAuth 2.0 implementation.",I see the documentation mentions a 'bearer token.'  What is a bearer token and how is it used?,"A bearer token is a security token used in OAuth 2.0. It's essentially a string of characters that represents the user's authorization to access a protected resource. You include this token in the 'Authorization' header of your requests to ERPNext's API, formatted as 'Authorization: Bearer <access_token>'. Think of it as a digital passport, proving your application's right to access data on the user's behalf."
"You are a Frappe Framework expert, specializing in OAuth 2.0 implementation.",Can you show me an example of how to make an authenticated request using a bearer token?,"Certainly! Let's use the `curl` command. Assuming you have a valid access token, you would make a request to an ERPNext API endpoint like this:

```bash
curl -H 'Authorization: Bearer <your_access_token>' https://{your_frappe_instance}/api/resource/path
```

Replace `<your_access_token>` with the actual bearer token you received from Frappe, and `<your_frappe_instance>` with your Frappe server address. Replace `/api/resource/path` with the actual API endpoint you want to access.

This will send a request to the specified resource with the necessary authorization information."
"You are a Frappe Framework expert, specializing in OAuth 2.0 implementation.",I want to implement the PKCE flow. How do I use the `code_challenge_method` and `code_challenge` parameters?,"The PKCE (Proof Key for Code Exchange) flow is a security enhancement to the OAuth 2.0 authorization code grant. It's particularly important for applications that use client-side JavaScript where it's difficult to keep secrets secure.

Here's how you use it:

1. **Generate a Code Verifier:** Create a random string, known as the code verifier.
2. **Generate a Code Challenge:** Hash the code verifier using SHA256 and encode it as base64. This is your code challenge.
3. **Authorization Request:** Include the `code_challenge_method` (set to 's256') and `code_challenge` parameters in your initial authorization request to Frappe. 
4. **Token Exchange:** When you exchange the authorization code for an access token, include the code verifier in the request body. Frappe will use this to verify the code challenge and ensure the request came from your application.

By using PKCE, you enhance security by ensuring that the authorization code is only exchanged for an access token when you have the original code verifier, making it harder for attackers to intercept and exploit the authorization process."
"You are a Frappe Framework expert, specializing in OAuth 2.0 implementation.",What are some common use cases for OAuth 2.0 in Frappe?,"OAuth 2.0 is a versatile tool with various applications in Frappe. Here are some common use cases:

1. **Third-party Integrations:**  Allowing external applications (like CRM, accounting software, or marketing automation platforms) to interact with ERPNext data securely, without requiring users to share their login credentials directly. 
2. **Single Sign-On (SSO):**  Enabling users to authenticate once and gain access to multiple Frappe applications or ERPNext instances. This improves user experience and reduces password management overhead. 
3. **API Access Control:**  Granting specific access permissions to different API clients, allowing fine-grained control over which data they can access and modify.
4. **Mobile Application Integration:**  Facilitating secure authentication and data access for mobile applications that interact with ERPNext. 
5. **Data Sharing and Collaboration:**  Allowing authorized users or applications to securely access and share data across different Frappe deployments or organizations."

You can also search for 'OAuth 2.0' within the Frappe documentation for more in-depth details and specific examples."
You are a Frappe framework expert.,How can I list all documents of a specific type using the Frappe REST API?,"You can list all documents of a specific type by making a GET request to the `/api/resource/{doctype}` endpoint. For example, to list all 'Person' documents, you would use the following URL: `GET /api/resource/Person`."
You are a Frappe framework expert.,I see the documentation mentions pagination. How does that work?,"By default, listings are paginated with 20 items per page. To adjust the page size, you can use the `limit_page_length` query parameter. For example, to get 50 items per page, you would use: `GET /api/resource/Person?limit_page_length=50`. To retrieve subsequent pages, you can use the `limit_start` query parameter, specifying the index of the first item on the next page. "
You are a Frappe framework expert.,What fields are included in the default response?,"By default, only the 'name' field is included in the listing. You can customize the fields you want to retrieve by using the `fields` query parameter, which should be a JSON array containing the desired field names. For example, to get the 'name' and 'first_name' fields: `GET /api/resource/Person/?fields=['name','first_name']`"
You are a Frappe framework expert.,Can I filter the listing results?,"Yes, you can filter the listing using SQL-like conditions by passing the `filters` query parameter. It should be a JSON array containing one or more filters. Each filter is an array in the format `[doctype, field, operator, operand]`. For instance, to get the names of all persons with the first name 'Jane': `GET /api/resource/Person?filters=[['Person','first_name','=','Jane']]`"
You are a Frappe framework expert.,I want to learn more about the Frappe REST API.

    cy.location('hash').should('eq', '/app/todo');
    cy.get('.list-row').should('contain', 'this is a test todo');
  });
});
```

This test checks for the creation of a new To Do, navigates to the ToDo list, and then verifies if the created ToDo is listed. You can modify and expand this example for your specific testing needs."
You are a Frappe Framework expert.,How do I run these Cypress tests locally?,"Cypress utilizes any Chromium-based browser installed on your system. Each Frappe app has its own Cypress test suite.  To run tests for the `frappe` app, navigate to the app's directory and execute the following commands:

```bash

To run a specific test file, you can pass the filename as an argument: `bench run-ui-tests --test frappe/tests/ui/test_list.js`.  Alternatively, you can use the Test Runner, which provides a user interface to load and execute your tests in the browser."
You are a Frappe framework expert.,What is the purpose of the `tests.txt` file in the `tests/ui` folder?,The `tests.txt` file in the `tests/ui` folder defines the sequence in which your UI tests will be run. This is important to ensure that tests are executed in a logical order and dependencies are met. Each line in the `tests.txt` file represents a test file that will be executed.
You are a Frappe framework expert.,How can I debug a failing UI test?,"To debug a failing UI test, you can open the test file in the Test Runner and execute it manually. This will allow you to step through the code and see where the error occurs. You can also use browser developer tools to inspect the UI elements and network requests during test execution."
You are a Frappe framework expert.,What is the advantage of using promises in UI tests?,"Promises are a great way to write test-friendly code, especially when dealing with asynchronous operations like AJAX calls. By returning a Promise object from a method that performs an asynchronous operation, you ensure that your tests can handle the response properly and wait for the operation to complete before continuing. This makes your tests more reliable and easier to debug."
You are a Frappe framework expert.,I'm looking for information on customizing Frappe Desk. Can you point me to some resources?,"Sure! The Frappe Framework documentation has a dedicated section on Desk Customization.

This guide provides detailed instructions on how to create different chart types and customize them according to your needs.
You are a Frappe Framework expert.,Can you explain the purpose of formatters for link fields in Frappe Framework?,"Formatters for link fields allow you to display both the ID (primary key) and a descriptive name for linked entities within a Frappe form. This enhances user readability and provides more context within the application. For instance, if you have an 'Employee' DocType with fields for 'employee_code' and 'employee_name', you can use a formatter to show both in a link field, improving data comprehension."
You are a Frappe Framework expert.,I'm interested in creating a formatter for link fields. Could you give me a basic example of how to implement this in a Frappe application?,"Certainly! Let's create a formatter for the 'Employee' DocType. This formatter will display both the 'employee_code' (primary key) and the 'employee_name' in a link field within forms. Here's the code snippet:

```python
frappe.form.link_formatters['Employee'] = function(value, doc) {
    if(doc.employee_name && doc.employee_name !== value) {
        return value + ': ' + doc.employee_name;
    }
    else {
        return value;
    }
}
```

This code snippet defines a formatter for 'Employee' DocType. The `value` argument represents the primary key ('employee_code'), and the `doc` argument represents the entire document containing both the primary key and the descriptive name. The formatter logic checks if the 'employee_name' exists and is different from the primary key, and if so, it concatenates both values to display them in the link field."
You are a Frappe Framework expert.,Where should I place this formatter code in my Frappe application?,"You have a couple of options to load this formatter code:

1. **Directly in the DocType script:** Add the code within the `frappe.ui.form.on(doctype, { ... })` block in your DocType's script file. This will ensure that the formatter is loaded alongside the DocType itself.
2. **In a custom script:** Create a custom script and include the formatter definition there. Ensure this custom script is loaded before the DocType. This provides a more modular approach, allowing you to consolidate formatter logic in separate scripts.
3. **In `build.json`:** Add the formatter definition within the `build.json` file for your application. This ensures the formatter is loaded during the build process and becomes part of your application's core functionality. This is useful for generic formatters that apply across multiple DocTypes."
You are a Frappe Framework expert.,Are there any prerequisites for using these formatters? What about the DocType structure?,"Yes, there are a few things to consider:

1. **DocType Structure:** Both the primary key (`name`) and the descriptive name (e.g., `employee_name`) must be present in the DocType's structure. The descriptive name field can be hidden if needed. This ensures the formatter has access to both pieces of data.
2. **Loading Time:** The formatter should be loaded before the DocType is loaded. This ensures that the formatter is available when the relevant forms are rendered. You can achieve this by using the methods mentioned earlier 鈥 directly in the DocType script, in a custom script, or in `build.json`.
3. **Reusability:** Once defined, the formatter can be reused for all forms that involve the linked DocType. This simplifies the process of displaying both the ID and name across your application.

Remember to check the [Frappe Framework documentation](https://frappeframework.com/docs/user/en/guides/desk/formatter_for_link_fields) for more details and advanced usage scenarios."

You can learn more about the different types of workspace blocks and their functionality in the documentation here: [Learn More 鈫抅(/docs/v14/user/en/desk/workspace/blocks). 
You are a Frappe Framework expert.,I'm interested in customizing my workspace. Can you explain how I can do that?,"Workspace has two modes: Read Only Mode and Edit Mode. You can start customizing by clicking on the 'Edit' button. You can make changes to the layout, add blocks, and rearrange elements to suit your preferences. You can find more detailed information about customizing workspaces in the documentation here: [Customizing Workspaces](/docs/v14/user/en/desk/workspace/customization#customizing-workspaces)."
You are a Frappe Framework expert.,"I'm trying to add new blocks to my workspace, but they're not appearing in the correct location. What's going on?","That's because the new workspace doesn't have the context to know where to place a new block. Adding blocks directly from the workspace document isn't recommended for this reason. It's better to use the workspace builder UI for all kinds of customization, as it offers more control and flexibility."
You are a Frappe Framework expert.,"Who can create, edit, or delete public workspaces?","Only users with the 'Workspace Manager Role' have the permissions to create, edit, or delete public workspaces. This ensures that the standard workspaces remain consistent and accurate for all users."
You are a Frappe Framework expert.,Can you tell me how to customize my workspace in Frappe?,"Sure! You can customize your workspace in Frappe by accessing the 'Edit' button. Your workspace operates in either 'Read Only Mode' or 'Edit Mode'. To start making changes, switch to 'Edit Mode'.  Keep in mind that customizing your workspace and customizing a workspace page are two distinct actions."
You are a Frappe Framework expert.,What are the different ways I can customize a workspace?,"Most workspace customizations can be done through the sidebar. These include editing workspace details, creating duplicates, deleting, hiding, and rearranging the workspace's position. The only customization not done through the sidebar is creating a new workspace."
You are a Frappe Framework expert.,How can I edit the details of my workspace?,"You can update the title, icon, and designate it as a parent or child workspace. You can also set it as public or private. Check out this GIF for a visual guide: [Edit Workspace Details](/files/EditWorkspaceDetails.gif)"

The specific link for the documentation on blocks is [https://frappeframework.com/docs/user/en/desk/workspace/blocks](https://frappeframework.com/docs/user/en/desk/workspace/blocks)."
You are an expert on the Frappe Framework.,How does Frappe handle user access to workspaces?,"Frappe allows for granular control over workspace access using a combination of modules and roles. Users can have access to different modules, and standard workspaces are visible based on that access. However, you can further restrict access to workspaces by assigning roles to users."
You are an expert on the Frappe Framework.,Can you give me an example of how module access affects workspace visibility?,"Sure. If a user has access to the 'Website' module, they will be able to see the 'Website Workspace'. However, if their access to the 'Website' module is removed, they will no longer see that workspace."
You are an expert on the Frappe Framework.,What if I want to prevent users with module access from seeing the workspace? How can I do that?,"You can use roles to further restrict access.  For example, you can configure it so that only users with the 'Website Manager' role can see the 'Website Workspace', even if they have access to the 'Website' module."
You are an expert on the Frappe Framework.,Can you give me a real-world scenario where roles are used to control workspace access?,"Imagine a manager, Jack Doe, who has the 'Workspace Manager' role. He wants to ensure that only users with the 'Website Manager' role can access the 'Website Workspace'. So, he sets up a configuration where users need both 'Website' module access and the 'Website Manager' role to view the workspace.  This way, even if a user like Jane Doe has access to the 'Website' module, she won't see the workspace unless she also has the 'Website Manager' role."
You are an expert on the Frappe Framework.,How do I set the default workspace for a user?,"You can configure the default workspace for each user in their 'User settings' form. This is accessible through the 'My Settings' option in your avatar menu. By default, the user will be shown the workspace they were last in."
You are a Frappe Framework expert.,What are Script Reports in Frappe Framework?,"Script Reports in Frappe Framework are custom reports built using Python scripts. They allow you to create complex reports that can't be achieved using the standard Report Builder or Query Report tools. Script Reports offer unrestricted access to data via Python scripts, allowing for greater flexibility and control."
You are a Frappe Framework expert.,Who can create Script Reports in Frappe Framework?,"Due to their unrestricted access and potential complexity, Script Reports can only be created by Administrators in Frappe Framework."
You are a Frappe Framework expert.,How do I create a Script Report in Frappe Framework?,"To create a Script Report, you'll need to enable Developer Mode in Frappe Framework. Then, type 'new report' in the awesomebar and hit Enter. Follow these steps:

1.  Set the Report Type to 'Script Report'.
2.  Set 'Is Standard' to 'Yes'.
3.  Select the Module where you want to add the report.
4.  A folder will be created for the report in the module's directory (e.g., `erpnext/accounts/report/[report-name]`).
5.  Write your Python script in the generated `{report-name}.py` file.
6.  You can add filters to your report by adding them to the `{report-name}.js` file."
You are a Frappe Framework expert.,Can you give me an example of how to use filters in a Script Report?,"Sure! In the `{report-name}.js` file, you can define filters for your report. These filters will be available as a dictionary in the `execute` method of your Python script. For example, to add a filter for 'company' in the 'Balance Sheet' report, you would add the following to the `Balance Sheet.js` file:

```javascript
frappe.query_reports['Balance Sheet'] = {
  filters: [
    {
      fieldname: 'company',
      label: __('Company'),
      fieldtype: 'Link',
      options: 'Company',
      default: frappe.defaults.get_user_default('company')
    }
  ]
};
```

This filter will be accessible in the `execute` method of your `Balance Sheet.py` script as a dictionary with the key 'company'. You can then use this filter value in your Python script."
You are a Frappe Framework expert.,Can you explain the difference between Standard and Custom Reports in Frappe Framework?,"Both Standard and Custom reports in Frappe Framework are designed to provide more flexibility than the basic Report Builder. However, they differ in how you write and deploy the script:

*   **Standard Reports:**
    *   You write the script in a separate `.py` file, following a defined structure with an `execute` method.  
    *   These reports are intended for development and are meant to be part of your application.  
    *   They are usually included in the codebase of a Frappe application (like ERPNext).
*   **Custom Reports:**
    *   You write the script directly within the Report document itself, using the Frappe Framework's [Script API](https://frappeframework.com/docs/user/en/desk/scripting/script-api).
    *   These reports offer the flexibility to create custom reports without needing to modify the application's codebase.

In essence, Custom Reports provide a faster and more flexible way to build reports for specific needs, while Standard Reports are more suited for integrated functionality within an application."
You are a Frappe Framework expert.,What are the key parameters returned by the `execute` method in a Script Report?,"The `execute` method in a Frappe Script Report is responsible for generating the data and structure for your report. It returns the following key parameters:

*   **`columns`:**  A list of dictionaries defining the columns to be displayed in the report's datatable. You specify each column's fieldname, label, fieldtype, and options (e.g., `Link`, `Currency`).
*   **`data`:**  A list of lists or a list of dictionaries containing the data to be displayed in the report. This could be fetched from a database query or other data sources.
*   **`message`:** An optional message to display in the report's UI.
*   **`chart`:**  An optional dictionary containing the configuration for the default chart to be shown in the report.
*   **`report_summary`:** An optional list of dictionaries representing summary values that are displayed separately at the top of the report.
*   **`skip_total_rows`:**  An optional boolean flag to control whether total rows should be displayed in the report."
You are a Frappe Framework expert.,Where can I find an example of a Script Report in the Frappe Framework?,"You can find an example of a Script Report in the ERPNext repository. The 'Balance Sheet' report is a good illustration. You can access it here: [https://github.com/frappe/erpnext/blob/develop/erpnext/accounts/report/balance_sheet/balance_sheet.py](https://github.com/frappe/erpnext/blob/develop/erpnext/accounts/report/balance_sheet/balance_sheet.py). This script demonstrates how to define columns, fetch data using SQL queries, and return the necessary parameters for the report's display."
You are a Frappe Framework expert.,What is the `depends_on` property used for in Script Report filters?,"The `depends_on` property in Script Report filters is used to control the visibility of a filter based on the value of another field. This allows you to create dynamic filters where the availability of one filter is dependent on the selection made in another.  For example, you could use `depends_on` to show a filter for 'periodicity' only when a specific 'company' is selected. The `depends_on` property can help you create more contextually relevant filters for your reports."
You are a Frappe Framework expert.,What are Query Reports in Frappe Framework?,Query Reports are reports in Frappe Framework that are generated using a single SQL query. They can be simple or complex as long as they generate columns and records. These reports can only be created by a System Manager and are stored in the database.
You are a Frappe Framework expert.,How do I create a Query Report in Frappe?,"To create a Query Report, type ""new report"" in the awesomebar and hit enter.

1. Set Report Type as ""Query Report""
2. Set the Reference DocType - Users that have access to the Reference DocType will have access to the report.
3. Set the Module - The report will appear in the ""Custom Reports"" section of the module.
4. Write your query."
You are a Frappe Framework expert.,What is the purpose of setting 'Standard' to 'Yes' in a Query Report?,"If you set Standard as ""Yes"" and Developer Mode is enabled, then a JSON file will be generated which you will have to check in to your version control. This is useful if you want to bundle Query Reports with your app. The Module will decide where the JSON file will go."
You are a Frappe Framework expert.,Can I configure columns and filters in a Query Report?,"Yes, you can configure the columns and filters in the Report document. You can set the label, width, format (fieldtype) for the columns and filters.

Filters can be used as formatting variables in the query. For example, a filter of type `customer` can be used as `%(customer)s` in the query."
You are a Frappe Framework expert.,Can you explain how column formatting works in Query Reports?,"You can format columns by specifying the label of the column in a particular format: `{label}:{optional fieldtype}{optional /}{optional options}:{optional width}`

For example, `Work Order:Link/Work Order:200` will be rendered as a Link Field with the DocType Work Order and the column width would be 200px."
You are a Frappe Framework expert.,Where can I find more information about Query Reports in Frappe Framework?,You can find more information about Query Reports on the Frappe Framework documentation website: [https://frappeframework.com/docs/user/en/desk/reports/query-report](https://frappeframework.com/docs/user/en/desk/reports/query-report).
You are a Frappe framework expert.,Can you tell me about Report Builder in Frappe?,"Report Builder is the simplest way to create reports in Frappe. It allows you to create reports without writing any code. You can use it to view records of a single DocType, as well as child records of Child Tables. You can also customize your reports by applying filters, sorting, and selecting columns. You can find more information about Report Builder on the Frappe documentation page, located at [https://frappeframework.com/docs/user/en/desk/reports/report-builder](https://frappeframework.com/docs/user/en/desk/reports/report-builder)."
You are a Frappe framework expert.,How do I save a custom report using Report Builder?,"By default, a Report View is generated for every DocType. However, you can create and save multiple custom reports based on various combinations of filters, ordering, columns, and other parameters. This allows you to tailor your reports to your specific needs and save them for future use."
You are a Frappe framework expert.,Can I update or delete a custom report I've created?,"Yes, you can update or delete any custom report you create using Report Builder. This gives you complete control over your reports and allows you to manage them effectively."
You are a Frappe framework expert.,How do I print a report from Report Builder?,You can print reports directly from the Report Builder interface. Simply navigate to the menu and select the print option. This allows you to generate hard copies of your reports for easy sharing and reference.
You are a Frappe framework expert.,Can I use aggregate functions in Report Builder?,"Yes, you can use aggregate functions like Count, Sum, and Average in Report Builder. This allows you to perform calculations on your data and get meaningful insights from your reports. You can apply the group by clause on columns to further analyze your data."
You are a Frappe framework expert.,Can I edit data directly from a Report Builder report?,"Yes, you can edit data directly from a Report Builder report. Since Report Builder is a view of a single DocType, you can make changes to the data directly within the report itself."
"You are an expert on Frappe Framework, specifically on Client Scripts.",What is a Client Script in Frappe?,"A Client Script in Frappe is a custom form script executed on the user's browser. It allows you to dynamically define JavaScript code that interacts with the Frappe form, enhancing its functionality and user experience. For instance, you can add custom validations, fetch data on field updates, modify field properties, or manage email recipients. Client Scripts provide a flexible way to tailor Frappe forms to specific business needs."
"You are an expert on Frappe Framework, specifically on Client Scripts.",I want to create a Client Script to validate the date field 'from_date' in the 'Task' DocType. How would I do that?,"You can achieve this by adding a Client Script to the 'Task' DocType. Here's how you would write the code:

```javascript
frappe.ui.form.on('Task', 'validate', function(frm) {
  if (frm.doc.from_date < get_today()) {
    msgprint('You cannot select a past date in From Date');
  }
});
```

This code snippet will check if the 'from_date' field is set to a date before today. If so, an error message will be displayed to the user, preventing them from saving the task with an invalid date."
"You are an expert on Frappe Framework, specifically on Client Scripts.",I've heard that Client Scripts are executed on the user's browser. Does that mean they're less secure than Server Scripts?,"While Client Scripts are executed on the user's browser, they are still considered secure due to Frappe's design. The frontend APIs used by Client Scripts are secure by design, meaning that they cannot directly access or modify server-side data.  Therefore, Client Scripts can perform many useful tasks without compromising security. However, for sensitive operations like database access or complex logic, it is recommended to use Server Scripts, which execute on the server-side and offer a more controlled environment."
"You are an expert on Frappe Framework, specifically on Client Scripts.",I'm trying to understand the differences between Client Scripts and Server Scripts. Can you explain it in a simple way?,"Think of Client Scripts as a way to enhance the user interface and user experience on the browser. They work directly with the Frappe form, adding validations, updating field values, and improving user interactions. On the other hand, Server Scripts are like the backstage crew, handling more complex logic, accessing databases, and performing tasks that require server-side processing. You can use both to create a robust and efficient Frappe application.  Remember, Client Scripts are great for client-side interactions, while Server Scripts are best for data processing and server-side logic."
"You are an expert on Frappe Framework, specifically on Client Scripts.",I want to create a Client Script to filter email recipients based on the 'quotation_to' field in the 'Quotation' DocType. Can you show me how to do that?,"You can achieve this using the `get_email_recipient_filters` function in the Client Script. Here's an example:

```javascript
frappe.ui.form.on(""Quotation"", {
  get_email_recipient_filters: function(frm, field) {
    if (field === ""recipients"") {
      return [
        [
          ""Dynamic Link"",
          ""link_doctype"",
          ""="",
          frm.doc.quotation_to
        ],
        [
          ""Dynamic Link"",
          ""link_name"",
          ""="",
          frm.doc.party_name
        ]
      ];
    }
  }
});
```

This code will filter the available email recipients in the email dialog to only show those linked to the 'quotation_to' and 'party_name' fields in the Quotation document. This helps to ensure that emails are sent to the correct recipients and reduces the potential for sending to unintended parties."
"You are an expert on Frappe Framework, specifically on Client Scripts.",I'm curious about the `get_today()` function mentioned in the Client Script examples. How does it work?,"The `get_today()` function is a built-in Frappe function that returns the current date in a specific format, usually a date object that you can then compare with other dates. It's a handy tool for validating dates, setting deadlines, or any other scenario where you need to work with the current date. You can find more details about the `get_today()` function in the Frappe documentation.  [Link to Frappe documentation - date functions] "
"You are an expert on Frappe Framework, specifically on Client Scripts.",Is there a way to set default email recipients using a Client Script? I want to pre-populate the email dialog with specific recipients for certain DocTypes.,"Yes, you can use the `get_email_recipients` function in a Client Script to set default email recipients for a specific DocType.  Here's an example of how you could set default 'bcc' recipients for the 'Quotation' DocType using a field called `custom_bcc`:

```javascript
frappe.ui.form.on(""Quotation"", {
  get_email_recipients: function (frm, field) {
    if (field === ""bcc"") {
      return [frm.doc.custom_bcc]
    }
  }
});
```

This script will populate the 'bcc' field in the email dialog with the value of the `custom_bcc` field from the Quotation document."

You are a Frappe Framework expert.,How can I enable server scripts on my bench?,"Server scripts are disabled by default on shared benches for security reasons. To enable them, you need to run the following command in your bench:

`bench set-config -g server_script_enabled 1`

If you are hosted on Frappe Cloud, you need to create a private bench to enable server scripts. Public shared benches do not allow server scripts."
You are a Frappe Framework expert.,What are the different types of server scripts?,"There are two main types of server scripts:

1. **Document Event Scripts:** These scripts are triggered by events associated with a specific document type, like 'Before Save', 'After Insert', etc.

2. **API Scripts:** These scripts create API endpoints that can be accessed through API calls. You can use the 'API Method' field to define the API endpoint name, which is automatically prefixed with `/api/method`. "
You are a Frappe Framework expert.,Can you give me an example of a server script that changes a property value before saving a document?,"```python
# Script Type: Before Save

if ""test"" in doc.description:
    doc.status = 'Closed'
```

This script will set the `status` field of a document to `Closed` if the `description` field contains the word ""test"" before the document is saved."
You are a Frappe Framework expert.,How can I use server scripts as internal libraries?,"You can use a server script as an internal library by setting a value in the `frappe.flags` dictionary within the script. This value can then be accessed from other server scripts. Here's an example:

**Script 1:**
```python
frappe.flags.my_key = 'my value'
```

**Script 2:**
```python
my_key = run_script('script_1').get('my_key')
```

In this example, Script 1 sets a value in `frappe.flags`, and Script 2 retrieves that value by calling `run_script` and accessing the `my_key` key."
You are a Frappe Framework expert.,What is the security model for server scripts?,"Frappe uses the RestrictedPython library to limit the methods that are available in server scripts, ensuring security. Only safe methods are allowed. You can find a list of allowed methods in the Frappe documentation: [https://frappeframework.com/docs/v14/user/en/desk/scripting/script-api](https://frappeframework.com/docs/v14/user/en/desk/scripting/script-api)."

You are a Frappe Framework expert.,What is Razorpay and how does it integrate with Frappe Framework?,"Razorpay is a popular payment gateway in India that allows businesses to accept, process, and disburse payments.  Frappe Framework integrates with Razorpay to enable businesses to accept online payments directly within their Frappe applications.  This integration involves creating an order on your backend and then using the Razorpay Checkout API to process the payment on the client side."
You are a Frappe Framework expert.,Can you explain the steps involved in integrating Razorpay into Frappe?,"Here's a breakdown of the steps involved in Razorpay integration within Frappe, based on the provided documentation:

1. **Include the Checkout Script:**  You need to embed the Razorpay checkout script on your Frappe webpage to initiate the payment process. This script handles the interaction with the Razorpay Checkout interface.
2. **Create the Order Controller:**  In your backend code (likely using Python), you'll define a function (e.g., `get_razorpay_order`) to create the payment order. This function sets the amount, reference details, and other relevant information for the transaction.
3. **Initiate the Payment:**  On the client-side (likely using Javascript), you'll use the Razorpay checkout API to display the payment modal. This API allows you to customize the modal's appearance and pre-fill customer information for a smoother checkout experience."
You are a Frappe Framework expert.,How does the payment process work after I initiate the payment in Frappe?,"Here's how the payment process flows once you initiate the payment using the Razorpay checkout API in Frappe:

1. **Order Creation:** The `razorpay.init()` function triggers the creation of an order on your Frappe backend. Your backend server interacts with Razorpay's API to generate a unique order ID.
2. **Razorpay Checkout:** The client receives the order ID from the backend and uses it to display the Razorpay checkout modal. The customer enters their payment information within the modal.
3. **Payment Verification:**  Once the customer completes the payment, Razorpay sends a confirmation to your Frappe backend. You'll need to have a server-side function to handle this confirmation, verify the payment, and update your Frappe database with the transaction details."
You are a Frappe Framework expert.,Can you give me an example of how to use the Razorpay checkout API in Frappe?,"Sure, here's an example of how to use the Razorpay checkout API in Frappe, based on the code provided in the documentation:

```javascript
function make_payment(ticket) {
  var options = {
    ""name"": ""<CHECKOUT MODAL TITLE>"",
    ""description"": ""<CHECKOUT MODAL DESCRIPTION>"",
    ""image"": ""<CHECKOUT MODAL LOGO>"",
    ""prefill"": {
      ""name"": ""<CUSTOMER NAME>"",
      ""email"": ""<CUSTOMER EMAIL>"",
      ""contact"": ""<CUSTOMER PHONE>""
    },
    ""theme"": {
      ""color"": ""<MODAL COLOR>""
    },
    ""doctype"": ""<REFERENCE DOCTYPE>"", // Mandatory
    ""docname"": ""<REFERENCE DOCNAME>"" // Mandatory
  };

  razorpay = new frappe.checkout.razorpay(options)
  razorpay.on_open = () => {
    // SCRIPT TO RUN WHEN MODAL OPENS
  }
  razorpay.on_success = () => {
    // SCRIPT TO RUN ON PAYMENT SUCCESS
  }
  razorpay.on_fail = () => {
    // SCRIPT TO RUN ON PAYMENT FAILURE
  }
  razorpay.init() // Creates the order and opens the modal
}
```

This code snippet defines a `make_payment` function. When called, it sets up the options for the Razorpay checkout modal, including the title, description, customer information, and theme.  It then uses the `razorpay.init()` method to open the modal and initiates the payment process. You would need to replace the placeholders within the code with your specific information."

You are a Frappe Framework expert.,"I'm configuring LDAP in Frappe. The documentation mentions 'Base Distinguished Name (DN).' What is that, and why is it important?","The Base Distinguished Name (DN) is a crucial part of setting up LDAP authentication in Frappe. It's basically the unique identifier of the user account within your LDAP directory that Frappe will use to bind to the server and access user information. Here's why it's essential:

1. **Authentication:** When you configure LDAP, you're essentially connecting your Frappe app to your existing LDAP server.  The Base DN acts as the 'key' that Frappe uses to authenticate with the server. It's like providing your username and password to access the directory.

2. **Permissions:** The user associated with the Base DN needs specific permissions within your LDAP directory. It needs to be authorized to view the search paths you define for users and groups, ensuring Frappe can retrieve the necessary data for authentication.

3. **Data Access:** The Base DN user is used to search and retrieve user details from the LDAP server.  It's the authorized entity that Frappe uses to access the information it needs to verify a user's login credentials.

In essence, the Base DN provides a secure connection and grants Frappe the necessary access to verify user credentials stored in your LDAP directory."
You are a Frappe Framework expert.,The LDAP configuration mentions 'LDAP Search Paths.'  Can you clarify what these are and how they relate to user authentication?,"LDAP Search Paths are essential for defining the specific locations within your LDAP directory where Frappe will look for user information during authentication. Think of them as 'addresses' that tell Frappe where to find users and groups. Here's a breakdown:

1. **Finding Users:** The 'LDAP search path for Users' specifies the directory location where all users who can log in to your Frappe app must reside. It's like a designated 'users' folder within your LDAP directory. 

2. **Finding Groups:**  The 'LDAP search path for Group' defines the location for all groups that are allowed to access your Frappe app.  This helps Frappe identify which groups are relevant for role mapping and permissions.

3. **Role Mapping:** When you map LDAP groups to Frappe roles, the 'LDAP Search Path for Group' ensures Frappe can correctly find the group memberships of users, allowing it to assign the appropriate roles in your Frappe application.

4. **Authentication Flow:** When a user tries to log in using LDAP credentials, Frappe uses the search paths to find the user within the specified LDAP directory. If the user is found, Frappe can verify the credentials and grant access to your Frappe app.

5. **Example:** If your LDAP directory has a structure where users are located under the path `ou=FrappeUsers,dc=example,dc=com`, you would enter this path in the 'LDAP search path for Users' field. 

By defining accurate search paths, you ensure that Frappe can locate users and groups efficiently during authentication and role mapping, ensuring a smooth and secure login process."
You are a Frappe Framework expert.,The documentation mentions 'LDAP Group Mappings.' How do I use this feature to control user access in my Frappe app?,"LDAP Group Mappings are a powerful feature that allows you to control user access and permissions within your Frappe app by mapping groups from your LDAP directory to specific Frappe roles. Here's how it works:

1. **LDAP Groups:** Your LDAP directory likely uses groups to organize users based on their roles or permissions within your organization. For example, you might have a 'Domain Users' group for all employees and a 'Domain Administrators' group for those with administrative privileges. 

2. **Frappe Roles:** Frappe uses roles to define access levels and permissions for different users in your application.  You can create roles like 'Guest,' 'User,' 'Manager,' and 'Administrator,' each with specific access rights. 

3. **Mapping:** The LDAP Group Mappings feature lets you create mappings between LDAP groups and Frappe roles. When a user logs in with their LDAP credentials, Frappe checks their group memberships in the LDAP directory. Based on these memberships, it assigns the corresponding Frappe roles to the user, granting them the appropriate access and permissions. 

4. **Example:** You could map the 'Domain Users' LDAP group to the 'Guest' role in Frappe. This means any user who belongs to the 'Domain Users' group in your LDAP directory will be assigned the 'Guest' role in your Frappe app. 

5. **Dynamic Role Assignment:** Frappe's LDAP integration automatically updates user roles based on their group memberships in the LDAP directory. So, if a user is added to a new group in your LDAP, their Frappe roles will be updated accordingly. 

**Benefits of LDAP Group Mappings:**

* **Centralized Permissions:** Manage user access centrally through your LDAP directory, reducing the need for manual role assignments in Frappe.
* **Consistent Role Assignment:** Ensures users get the appropriate roles based on their LDAP group memberships.
* **Simplified Administration:**  Streamline user access management by leveraging existing LDAP group structures."

"You are an expert on the Frappe Framework, specifically the `bench` command-line interface.",I'm interested in extending the `bench` command line. Can you explain how to add custom commands?,"Absolutely! To create your own custom `bench` commands, you'll need to create a `commands` module within your custom Frappe application. This module will contain the logic for your command, wrapped using the `click` library. Here's a breakdown of the process:

1. **Create a `commands` Module:**  Within your custom application's directory, create a `commands` folder (e.g., `frappe-bench/apps/my_app/my_app/commands`).
2. **Write Your Command:**  Inside the `commands` folder, create a Python file (e.g., `my_command.py`). This file will contain your custom command logic using `click` for argument parsing and command structure. 
3. **Define the Command:**  Use `@click.command` to define your command, specifying its name and any arguments. 
4. **Implement Logic:**  Within the command function, implement the logic for your command, using any necessary imports from your application.
5. **Add to `commands` List:**  Create a `commands` list in your `commands` module (e.g., `commands.py`) and append your command function to it. This list tells `bench` about the available commands within your application.

For a detailed example, refer to the documentation at [https://frappeframework.com/docs/user/en/bench/extending-the-cli](https://frappeframework.com/docs/user/en/bench/extending-the-cli)."
"You are an expert on the Frappe Framework, specifically the `bench` command-line interface.","I've created my custom command in the `commands` module, but it's not showing up when I run `bench`.","Let's troubleshoot! Here are a few things to check:

1. **Module Structure:** Ensure your `commands` module is located correctly within your custom application's directory. It should be at the same level as your application's main directory. For example, if your application is named `my_app`, the structure should be `frappe-bench/apps/my_app/my_app/commands`.
2. **`commands` List:** Double-check that your custom command function has been added to the `commands` list in your `commands` module. Make sure the list is properly defined and accessible from your command file.
3. **`click` Import:**  Make sure you've imported `click` correctly at the top of your command file. 
4. **`bench` Restart:** After making any changes, restart your `bench` server to ensure the new commands are recognized.

If you're still encountering issues, please provide more details about the structure of your application and your custom command, including relevant code snippets, so I can assist you further."
"You are an expert on the Frappe Framework, specifically the `bench` command-line interface.",Can you give me an example of how to write a custom `bench` command that takes an argument?,"Of course! Here's an example of a custom `bench` command that takes an argument using the `click` library:

```python
# file_path: frappe-bench/apps/my_app/my_app/commands/my_command.py
import click

@click.command('my-command')
@click.argument('value', type=str)
def my_command(value):
    print(f'You entered the value: {value}')

commands = [
    my_command
]
```

**Explanation:**

* **`@click.command('my-command')`:** Defines the command name as `my-command`.
* **`@click.argument('value', type=str)`:** Declares an argument named `value` of type `str` (string) for the command.
* **`def my_command(value):`:** Defines the command function, accepting the `value` argument.
* **`print(f'You entered the value: {value}')`:**  Prints the entered value.  This demonstrates how you would use the argument within your command's logic.
* **`commands = [my_command]`:** Adds the command function to the `commands` list, making it available as a `bench` command.

Now, you can execute your command from the command line like this:

`bench my-command Hello World`

This will output: `You entered the value: Hello World`

Remember to restart your `bench` server to see your new command."

You are a Frappe Framework expert.,Where is the domain configuration stored?,The domain configuration is stored in the respective site's `site_config.json` file.
You are a Frappe Framework expert.,"After adding the custom domain, what steps should I take to make it work?","Once you add the custom domain, you need to regenerate the Nginx configuration by running `bench setup nginx` and reload the Nginx service with `sudo service nginx reload` to put your custom domain into effect. This ensures that your webserver is aware of the new domain and routes traffic correctly."
You are a Frappe Framework expert.,Can you explain the steps involved in adding a custom domain in detail?,"Certainly! Here's a breakdown of the steps to add a custom domain to your Frappe site:

1. **Run the command:** `bench setup add-domain [desired-domain]` to initiate the process.
2. **Select the site:** You'll be asked to choose the site you want to associate the custom domain with. Select the appropriate site from the list.
3. **Optional: Set up SSL:** If you wish to enable SSL for your custom domain, provide the paths to your SSL certificate and key files using the `--ssl-certificate` and `--ssl-certificate-key` options respectively. For instance: `--ssl-certificate /etc/letsencrypt/live/erpnext.cert --ssl-certificate-key /etc/letsencrypt/live/erpnext.key`
4. **Regenerate Nginx configuration:** After adding the domain, run `bench setup nginx` to update the Nginx configuration file.
5. **Reload Nginx service:** Execute `sudo service nginx reload` to apply the changes and make your custom domain functional."
You are a Frappe Framework expert.,Where can I find more detailed information about adding custom domains to a Frappe site?,You can find a comprehensive guide on adding custom domains to a Frappe site in the official documentation: [https://frappeframework.com/docs/user/en/bench/guides/adding-custom-domains](https://frappeframework.com/docs/user/en/bench/guides/adding-custom-domains).
You are a Frappe Framework expert.,How can I configure HTTPS for my Frappe site?,"To configure HTTPS for your Frappe site, you need to obtain an SSL certificate and set up Nginx to use it. You can get a certificate from a trusted Certificate Authority or generate your own.  For self-signed certificates, your browser will show a warning that the certificate is not trusted. You can find a tutorial on how to use Let's Encrypt for a free SSL Certificate here: [https://frappeframework.com/docs/user/en/bench/guides/lets-encrypt-ssl-setup.html](https://frappeframework.com/docs/user/en/bench/guides/lets-encrypt-ssl-setup.html)."
You are a Frappe Framework expert.,What are the prerequisites for configuring HTTPS?,"Before you can configure HTTPS, you need to meet the following prerequisites:

1.  **DNS Multitenant Setup:** You need to have a [DNS Multitenant Setup](https://frappe.io/docs/v14/user/en/bench/guides/setup-multitenancy).
2.  **Valid Domain:** Your site should be accessible via a valid domain.
3.  **Root Permissions:** You need root permissions on your server.
4.  **Valid Certificate:** You need a valid certificate generated through a trusted Certificate Authority or a Self-Signed Certificate."
You are a Frappe Framework expert.,How do I generate a CSR and key file?,"To generate a CSR and the corresponding key file, you can use the following command:

```bash
openssl req -new -newkey rsa:2048 -nodes -keyout mydomain.com.key -out mydomain.com.csr
```

This command will create two files: `mydomain.com.key` (private key) and `mydomain.com.csr` (CSR). You need to upload the CSR file to a private certificate authority like GoDaddy or ComodoSSL to generate a valid certificate (.crt) file."
You are a Frappe Framework expert.,What if I have multiple certificates?,"If you have multiple certificates, you'll need to concatenate them into a single certificate bundle. For example, you could use this command to combine your primary certificate (`your_certificate.crt`) and intermediate certificate (`CA.crt`):

```bash
cat your_certificate.crt CA.crt >> certificate_bundle.crt
```

This will create a new file called `certificate_bundle.crt` that contains both certificates."
You are a Frappe Framework expert.,How do I move the certificate and private key files to the correct location?,"You need to move the certificate and private key files to a secure location. First, create a directory for SSL configuration:

```bash
mkdir /etc/nginx/conf.d/ssl
```

Then, move your private key and certificate bundle to this directory:

```bash
mv private.key /etc/nginx/conf.d/ssl/private.key
mv certificate_bundle.crt /etc/nginx/conf.d/ssl/certificate_bundle.crt
```

Make sure that your private key is only readable by the root user:

```bash
chown root private.key
chmod 600 private.key
```"
You are a Frappe Framework expert.,How do I set up the Nginx configuration to use the certificate and private key?,"Use the `bench` command to set the paths to your certificate and private key for your Frappe site. Replace `site1.local` with your actual site name:

```bash
bench set-ssl-certificate site1.local /etc/nginx/conf.d/ssl/certificate_bundle.crt
bench set-ssl-key site1.local /etc/nginx/conf.d/ssl/private.key
```"
You are a Frappe Framework expert.,How do I generate the Nginx configuration?,"Run the following command to generate the Nginx configuration:

```bash
bench setup nginx
```

This will configure Nginx to use the specified SSL certificate and private key."
You are a Frappe Framework expert.,How do I reload Nginx after the configuration is complete?,"After you've set up the Nginx configuration, reload Nginx to apply the changes. You can do this using one of the following commands:

- **Ubuntu/Debian:**
```bash
sudo service nginx reload
```

- **CentOS 7:**
```bash
systemctl reload nginx
```"
You are a Frappe Framework expert.,What happens after I configure SSL?,"Once you configure SSL, all HTTP traffic to your Frappe site will be redirected to HTTPS. This means that all communication between your users and your site will be encrypted, providing a more secure experience."
You are a Frappe framework expert.,I'm having trouble with scheduled jobs in Frappe. They're not running as expected. How can I diagnose the issue?,"You can use several commands to diagnose scheduler issues. The documentation for these commands can be found on the Frappe website, at https://frappeframework.com/docs/user/en/bench/guides/diagnosing-the-scheduler. One of the most helpful commands is `bench doctor`, which will show you the scheduler status, the number of workers, and any pending tasks."
You are a Frappe framework expert.,What information does the `bench doctor` command provide?,"The `bench doctor` command provides you with the following information:

- **Scheduler Status per Site:** This tells you if the scheduler is running or stopped for each site you have.
- **Number of Workers:** This shows you how many workers are currently active for the scheduler.
- **Pending Tasks:** This will list out the tasks that are waiting to be processed by the scheduler."
You are a Frappe framework expert.,What is the ideal output of the `bench doctor` command?,"Ideally, you should see workers online and no pending jobs. The output would look something like this:

```
Workers online: 0
-----None Jobs-----
```"
You are a Frappe framework expert.,"If my scheduled jobs are delayed, what command can I use to see the pending jobs?","You can use the command `bench --site [site-name] show-pending-jobs`. This will show you a list of all the pending jobs, including the queue they are in and the tasks within each queue."
You are a Frappe framework expert.,How do I clear out all pending jobs?,"You can use the command `bench purge-jobs` to remove all pending jobs from all queues. Be careful with this command, as it will permanently delete all pending jobs."
You are a Frappe framework expert.,I want to secure my Frappe site with HTTPS using Let's Encrypt. How do I get started?,"To use Let's Encrypt with your Frappe site, you need to fulfill a few prerequisites. First, ensure you have a DNS Multitenant Setup as outlined in the [Frappe Documentation](https://frappe.io/docs/v14/user/en/bench/guides/setup-multitenancy). Second, your site needs to be accessible via a valid domain. Finally, you'll need root permissions on your server. Once these are met, you can use the `bench` command to automate the process."
You are a Frappe framework expert.,"Okay, I have everything set up. How do I use the `bench` command to obtain a Let's Encrypt certificate?","Simply run the following command in your terminal:

`sudo -H bench setup lets-encrypt [site-name]`

This will guide you through the process, asking for necessary information like your email address and domain name. The command will also automatically add a cron job to renew the certificate every month."
You are a Frappe framework expert.,What if I want to secure a custom domain with Let's Encrypt?,"You can use the `--custom-domain` option with the `bench` command to achieve this. The command would look like this:

`sudo -H bench setup lets-encrypt [site-name] --custom-domain [custom-domain]`

Just replace `[custom-domain]` with the actual domain name you want to secure."
You are a Frappe framework expert.,"How often do Let's Encrypt certificates expire, and how do I renew them?","Let's Encrypt certificates are valid for three months. To renew them manually, you can run the command `sudo bench renew-lets-encrypt`. Alternatively, the `bench` command will automatically configure cron jobs to renew the certificates every month. Remember, it's crucial to renew these certificates before they expire to ensure continuous HTTPS security for your Frappe site."
You are a Frappe framework expert.,What if I prefer to handle the certificate setup manually?,"You can manually obtain certificates using the Certbot tool. First, download the `Certbot-auto` script from [https://certbot.eff.org/](https://certbot.eff.org/) and place it in the `/opt` directory. Then, stop the nginx service by running `sudo service nginx stop`. Next, run the following command in your terminal: 

`./opt/certbot-auto certonly --standalone`

You'll be prompted for your email address, agreement to the Let's Encrypt terms, and your domain name(s).  Certbot will then generate the necessary certificate files, which are stored in `/etc/letsencrypt/live/example.com`."
You are a Frappe framework expert.,"After I've got the certificate files, what do I do next?","Navigate to your Frappe site's `site_config.json` file, which is located at `frappe-bench/sites/{{site_name}}`. Add the following two lines to your `site_config.json` file to configure the certificates:

```json
""ssl_certificate"": ""/etc/letsencrypt/live/example.com/fullchain.pem"",
""ssl_certificate_key"": ""/etc/letsencrypt/live/example.com/privkey.pem""
```

Remember to replace `example.com` with your actual domain name. Then, regenerate the nginx configuration using `bench setup nginx` and restart the nginx service with `sudo service nginx restart`. Your Frappe site should now be secured with HTTPS!"
You are a Frappe framework expert.,How can I ensure that my certificates are automatically renewed?,"Log in as root or a user with superuser privileges and run `crontab -e`. Add the following line to your crontab to automatically renew your certificates on the first Monday of every month:

```bash
# renew letsencrypt certificates on 1st monday of every month and get an email if it gets executed
MAILTO=""mail@example.com""
0 0 1-7 * * [ ""$(date '+\%a')"" = ""Mon"" ] && sudo service nginx stop && /opt/certbot-auto renew && sudo service nginx start
```

Replace `mail@example.com` with your email address. This will ensure that your certificates are renewed automatically and you'll receive an email notification when the renewal process is complete."
You are a Frappe Framework expert.,I want to set limits for my Frappe site. How do I do that?,You can set limits and restrictions for your Frappe site by modifying the `site_config.json` file. This file is located inside the site's folder. You can access and edit it using the `bench` command.
You are a Frappe Framework expert.,Can you give me an example of how to set a limit using the `bench` command?,"Sure. To set a limit on the number of users to 5 for a site called `site1.local`, you would run the following command:

You are an expert on the Frappe Framework and its documentation.,I'm looking to set up multiple sites on my Frappe instance. How do I do that?,"You can set up multiple sites using Frappe's multitenancy feature.  There are two main ways to do this: port-based multitenancy and DNS-based multitenancy. You can find more information on this in the Frappe documentation, specifically the guide on 'Setup Multitenancy' at [https://frappeframework.com/docs/user/en/bench/guides/setup-multitenancy](https://frappeframework.com/docs/user/en/bench/guides/setup-multitenancy)."
You are an expert on the Frappe Framework and its documentation.,I want to run my new site on a different port than my existing one. How can I do that?,"You can achieve this using port-based multitenancy. First, you'll need to disable DNS-based multitenancy using the command `bench config dns_multitenant off`. Then, create your new site with `bench new-site site2name`. Next, set the desired port for your new site using `bench set-nginx-port site2name 82` (replace `82` with your chosen port). Finally, regenerate the nginx configuration with `bench setup nginx` and reload nginx with `sudo service nginx reload`."
You are an expert on the Frappe Framework and its documentation.,I want my new site to be accessible using a unique domain name. How can I do this?,"You can achieve this using DNS-based multitenancy. First, you'll need to enable DNS-based multitenancy with the command `bench config dns_multitenant on`. Then, create your new site with `bench new-site site2name`. Next, regenerate the nginx configuration using `bench setup nginx` and reload nginx with `sudo service nginx reload`.  You can then configure your DNS to point the unique domain name to your Frappe server."
You are an expert on the Frappe Framework and its documentation.,Is it possible to change the default site on my Frappe instance?,"Yes, you can change the default site.  You can do this using the command `bench use sitename`, where `sitename` is the name of the site you want to set as the default."

You are a Frappe Framework expert.,What are background services in Frappe?,"Background services in Frappe are essential processes that run in the background to keep your Frappe environment functional. They handle tasks like managing databases, processing jobs, and scheduling events."
You are a Frappe Framework expert.,Can you explain the different types of background services in Frappe?,"Frappe background services can be categorized into two types: System Processes and Frappe Processes. System Processes are managed at a system level and handle essential tasks like database management (MariaDB/PostgreSQL), queuing (Redis), and reverse proxying (NGINX). Frappe Processes, on the other hand, are defined and managed within the Frappe codebase, and they include things like the WSGI Server, Redis Worker Processes, and the Scheduler Process."
You are a Frappe Framework expert.,What does the WSGI server do in Frappe?,"The WSGI server is responsible for handling HTTP requests to your Frappe application. In development environments, you'll typically use the Werkzeug server started with `bench serve` or `bench start`. For production setups, Frappe uses Gunicorn, which is automatically configured by Bench within the Supervisor process."
You are a Frappe Framework expert.,How are Redis Worker Processes used in Frappe?,"Redis Worker Processes are key for executing background jobs within the Frappe system. They handle tasks that might take a while, like sending emails, processing large data sets, or generating reports. These processes are automatically started when you run `bench start` and are configured in Supervisor for production environments."
You are a Frappe Framework expert.,What is the role of the Scheduler Process in Frappe?,The Scheduler Process is responsible for scheduling and enqueuing jobs that need to be executed at specific times or intervals. Think of it as a task manager that ensures your scheduled tasks run on time. It's automatically started with `bench start` and configured in Supervisor for production deployments.
You are a Frappe Framework expert.,Where can I find more detailed information about these background services and how they are configured?,"You can find comprehensive documentation on Frappe background services at the following link: [https://frappeframework.com/docs/user/en/bench/resources/background-services](https://frappeframework.com/docs/user/en/bench/resources/background-services). This page provides details on each service, their configurations, and how they fit into the overall Frappe architecture."

You can also enable features like profiling, proxy support, and disabling automatic server restarts when files change using various flags."
You are a Frappe framework expert.,What is a Bench Procfile?,"A Bench Procfile is a configuration file used to define and manage multiple processes within the Frappe framework, specifically in developer mode. It's used by the `bench start` command, which leverages the Honcho tool to orchestrate these processes. You can find more information about this on the official Frappe documentation: [https://frappeframework.com/docs/user/en/bench/resources/bench-procfile](https://frappeframework.com/docs/user/en/bench/resources/bench-procfile)."
You are a Frappe framework expert.,What are the main processes defined in the Bench Procfile?,"The Bench Procfile defines a set of essential processes for running Frappe applications. These include:

1. **`bench start`:** The web server process.
2. **`redis_cache`:** A Redis instance used for general caching.
3. **`redis_queue`:** A Redis instance for managing queues for background workers.
4. **`redis_socketio`:** A Redis instance acting as a message broker for real-time updates and communication from background workers.
5. **`web`:** The Frappe web server process.

8. **`worker_*`:** A group of Redis workers handling asynchronous jobs, with different queues like `short`, `long`, and `default`."
You are a Frappe framework expert.,What is the purpose of the `bench watch` process?,The `bench watch` process is specifically for developers. It automatically rebuilds the Desk JavaScript application whenever changes are detected. This ensures that any updates you make to the frontend code are reflected in the running application without needing to manually restart it.
You are a Frappe framework expert.,Can you explain the sample Procfile you provided?,"The sample Procfile demonstrates how to configure each process. Let's break it down:

* **`redis_cache: redis-server config/redis_cache.conf`**: Starts the Redis server for caching using the configuration file `config/redis_cache.conf`.
* **`redis_socketio: redis-server config/redis_socketio.conf`**: Starts the Redis server for Socket.IO messaging using `config/redis_socketio.conf`.
* **`redis_queue: redis-server config/redis_queue.conf`**: Starts the Redis server for managing worker queues using `config/redis_queue.conf`.
* **`web: bench serve --port 8000`**: Runs the Frappe web server on port 8000 using the `bench serve` command.
* **`socketio: /usr/bin/node apps/frappe/socketio.js`**: Starts the Socket.IO process using the Node.js runtime and the `socketio.js` file located in the `apps/frappe` directory.
* **`watch: bench watch`**: Starts the `bench watch` process for automatic development builds.
* **`schedule: bench schedule`**: Starts the scheduling process for running periodic tasks.
* **`worker_short: bench worker --queue short`**: Starts a worker process with the `short` queue.
* **`worker_long: bench worker --queue long`**: Starts a worker process with the `long` queue.
* **`worker_default: bench worker --queue default`**: Starts a worker process with the `default` queue."
You are a Frappe Framework expert.,I'm working on a project that requires database schema changes. How can I migrate my existing Frappe site to the new schema?,"You can use the `bench migrate` command to migrate your existing Frappe site's database to the new schema. This will apply all the schema changes you've made in your apps. The command looks like this:

```bash
bbench --site [sitename] migrate
```

Remember to enable Developer Mode before making any schema changes."
You are a Frappe Framework expert.,I'm confused about how schema changes work in Frappe. Can you explain it to me?,"Sure! In Frappe, you define your database structure through DocTypes. Each DocType represents a table in your database. When you edit a DocType by adding, removing, or changing fields, Frappe creates a JSON file representing that DocType in your app's source tree.

When you install an app on a site, Frappe uses these JSON files to create the corresponding database tables. Running `migrate` ensures all apps are upgraded to their current version, updating the database schema based on the latest DocType definitions."
You are a Frappe Framework expert.,What happens when I run `migrate`?  Can you explain the process?,"Here's a breakdown of the `migrate` process:

1. **Before Migrate Hook:**  Frappe first runs the `before_migrate` hook to synchronize user permissions.
2. **Patch Execution:**  Then, it executes any patches defined in your apps. Patches are used for data migrations, so they can change existing data in your database.
3. **Component Synchronization:** Next, Frappe synchronizes several components with the latest changes, including:
    * Database Schema
    * Background Jobs
    * Fixtures (Read more about fixtures [here](https://frappeframework.com/docs/v13/user/en/python-api/hooks#fixtures))
    * Dashboards, Desktop Icons, and Web Pages
    * Translations
    * Search Index for all routes
4. **DocType Checksum Comparison:**  For DocTypes, Frappe compares the MD5 hash of the JSON file with the hash stored in the database. If they don't match, the DocType is reloaded.
5. **After Migrate Hook:** Finally, the `after_migrate` hook is executed to complete the migration process.

You can find a detailed breakdown of commands executed during the migration process at [bench-site-commands](https://frappeframework.com/docs/user/en/python-api/hooks#fixtures)."
You are a Frappe Framework expert.,"I understand the schema changes, but what if I need to modify data in my database directly? How do I do that?","In Frappe, you would use **patches** for data migrations. Patches are Python scripts that run during the `migrate` process and allow you to manipulate data in your database. You can write your patch script by creating a Python file with an `execute` function and adding it to the `patches.txt` file in your app's directory.

Here's a simple example of a patch script:

```python
import frappe

def execute():
    frappe.db.set_value('Customer', 'customer_name', 'New Value', 'customer_email', 'test@example.com')
```

This script would update the `customer_name` field for the customer with the email `test@example.com` to `New Value`.

Remember to include the path to your patch script in `patches.txt` so it can be executed during the `migrate` process."
You are a Frappe Framework expert.,I've heard about 'post-model sync' patches. What are they and when should I use them?,"Post-model sync patches are a special type of patch that run *after* Frappe has synced the DocType models with the database. This means you don't need to reload the DocTypes during your patch execution, as the schema is already in sync. These patches are particularly useful when you don't need to access the old schema during your data migration.

You can define post-model sync patches in the `[post_model_sync]` section of your `patches.txt` file. For example:

```
[pre_model_sync]
app.module.patch1
app.module.patch2

[post_model_sync]
app.module.patch3
app.module.patch4
```

This would execute `patch3` and `patch4` after the DocType models have been synchronized with the database."
You are a Frappe Framework expert.,I'm curious about the order in which patches are executed. Can you explain how that works?,"Patches are executed in the order they are defined in your `patches.txt` file. Each patch must be uniquely defined on a single line. If a patch has been executed before, it won't be run again unless you make a change to it or add a comment to the line in `patches.txt`. For example, adding a comment like `#2019-09-08` will make the patch appear as new, and it will be executed again during the `migrate` process."
You are a Frappe Framework expert.,I'm a little confused about how the schema changes relate to the data migration patches. Can you give me a simple example?,"Imagine you have a `Customer` DocType with a field named `customer_phone`. You want to add a new field `customer_mobile` to capture mobile numbers separately.  Here's how you'd approach it using schema changes and data migrations:

1. **Schema Change:**  In your DocType editor, add the new field `customer_mobile`.  Frappe will update the JSON file for `Customer` with this change. 
2. **Data Migration:**  Now, you need to move the existing phone numbers into the `customer_mobile` field. You can write a patch script to do this. For example:

```python
import frappe

def execute():
    customers = frappe.get_all('Customer', fields=['customer_phone', 'customer_mobile'])
    for customer in customers:
        if customer.customer_phone:
            frappe.db.set_value('Customer', customer.name, 'customer_mobile', customer.customer_phone)
            frappe.db.set_value('Customer', customer.name, 'customer_phone', None)
```

This patch script iterates through all customers, and if the `customer_phone` field has a value, it copies the value to the `customer_mobile` field and then clears the `customer_phone` field. 

By making these schema changes and writing a data migration patch, you've successfully migrated your database to the new structure while preserving your existing data."
You are a Frappe Framework expert.,What happens if I want to remove a field from a DocType? Will the data be deleted?,"Good question!  Frappe handles field removal in a way that avoids accidental data loss. While the field will no longer be visible in the form view, the corresponding database column won't be deleted. This is done to provide flexibility. If you need to access the data from the removed field for any reason, you can still write patches that access it. However, remember that Frappe doesn't support reverse schema migrations, so you can't bring back a deleted field."
You are an expert on the Frappe Framework.,I'm looking to deploy a Frappe-based site to production. What's the recommended tool for managing deployments?,"For managing Frappe deployments, the recommended tool is `bench`. It's a CLI (Command Line Interface) tool designed for this purpose. You can find more information on `bench` at its GitHub repository: [https://github.com/frappe/bench](https://github.com/frappe/bench)"
You are an expert on the Frappe Framework.,How do I install `bench` for production deployments?,"You can install `bench` using the Easy Install script, which is available on GitHub at [https://github.com/frappe/bench#easy-install-script](https://github.com/frappe/bench#easy-install-script).  Make sure to use the `--production` flag when running the script. The command should look like this: `sudo python install.py --production --user [frappe-user]`."
You are an expert on the Frappe Framework.,"After I've installed `bench`, how do I create a new site for my production deployment?","Once `bench` is installed, navigate to the `frappe-bench` directory. You can then create a new site using the command `bench new-site example.com`, replacing `example.com` with your desired site domain."
You are an expert on the Frappe Framework.,I want to use ERPNext on my production site. How do I install it using `bench`?,"You can install ERPNext using the `bench get-app` command. Run `bench get-app erpnext` to download the ERPNext app. Once downloaded, you can install it onto your site with `bench --site example.com install-app erpnext`, again replacing `example.com` with your site domain."
You are an expert on the Frappe Framework.,How can I check if everything is set up correctly after deploying my site?,"You can check the supervisor status to confirm that all the necessary Frappe processes are running. Use the command `sudo supervisorctl status`. If you see entries like `frappe-bench-web:frappe-bench-frappe-web RUNNING` and other similar lines, it means your deployment is successful. If you own the domain name and it's mapped to your server's IP address, your site should be accessible at the domain (e.g., `example.com`)."
You are an expert on the Frappe Framework.,How do I update my Frappe production site after initial deployment?,"You can update your site using the `bench update` command. This command will update all your apps by pulling the latest changes, run any necessary patches, build JavaScript and CSS assets, and restart the supervisor. You can also selectively update specific aspects of your site. For example, to only update the apps, run `bench update --pull`. You can check the documentation at [https://frappeframework.com/docs/user/en/production-setup](https://frappeframework.com/docs/user/en/production-setup) for more detailed information on update options."
You are an expert on the Frappe Framework.,"What are Redis namespaces, and why are they important in production?","Redis namespaces help to isolate data between different Frappe deployments that might be sharing the same Redis instance. This is crucial for security and data integrity, as it prevents accidental data conflicts or unauthorized access. You can enable Redis namespaces in Frappe using the `bench create-rq-users` command. This command generates an ACL file (Access Control List) which configures access permissions. Make sure your Redis configuration file (e.g., `redis_queue.conf`) is set up to use this ACL file. You can find more information on Redis namespaces in the Frappe documentation at [https://frappeframework.com/docs/user/en/production-setup](https://frappeframework.com/docs/user/en/production-setup)."
You are a Frappe Framework expert.,Can you tell me more about Zero* Downtime Migrations in Frappe?,"Zero* downtime migrations in Frappe allow you to upgrade your site while keeping it running in read-only mode. This ensures a seamless experience for your users, as static content and dynamic pages that only need to read data will continue working without any noticeable difference. Only actions requiring database writes will be temporarily disabled."
You are a Frappe Framework expert.,How does Zero* Downtime Migration actually work?,"Frappe utilizes two methods to achieve read-only mode during upgrades:

1. **Using Read-Replicas:** This involves setting up a secondary database that mirrors the primary database. During the upgrade, requests are routed to the read-replica, ensuring read operations continue without disruption.

2. **Using Read-Only Transactions:** If read-replicas aren't configured, the database itself provides read-only transactions, allowing only read operations during the upgrade process.

In either case, database writes are disabled until the maintenance mode is lifted, ensuring data integrity during the upgrade."
You are a Frappe Framework expert.,Are there any limitations or things to consider with Zero* Downtime Migrations?,"While Zero* Downtime Migrations aim to minimize downtime, some limitations exist:

* **Not all apps are inherently compatible:** Apps not designed for read-only mode might behave unpredictably during an upgrade.
* **Database Schema Changes can cause Glitches:** Client-side apps need to be updated after schema changes during upgrades, which might lead to occasional glitches. However, the goal is to minimize downtime, not completely eliminate it."
You are a Frappe Framework expert.,How do I enable read-only mode during upgrades in Frappe?,"To enable read-only mode, you need to follow these steps:

1. **Optional but Recommended:** Set up a read replica using the [replication guide](https://frappeframework.com/docs/v14/user/en/guides/database-settings/setup-read-from-secondary-db) for optimal performance.

2. **Enable Read-Only Mode:** Edit your site configuration using the command: `bench --site develop set-config allow_reads_during_maintenance 1`

This will activate the read-only mode for your site during upgrades."
You are a Frappe Framework expert.,I am an app developer. How can I ensure my app supports Zero* Downtime Migrations?,"To support Zero* Downtime Migrations in your app, you need to make some modifications:

**Server-side changes:**

* Use the `frappe.flags.read_only` flag to check if the site is in read-only mode. You can conditionally disable or modify your app's behavior based on this flag. For example, you might want to prevent database write operations during the upgrade.

**Client-side changes:**

* Update the user interface to clearly indicate that the app is in read-only mode. This might involve displaying warnings or disabling certain functionalities that involve write operations. You can utilize the `read_only_mode` key available in the website context to conditionally toggle features on your pages.

By implementing these changes, you can ensure your app behaves appropriately during Zero* Downtime Migrations."
You are a Frappe Framework expert.,Can you give me an example of how to use `frappe.flags.read_only` in my server-side code?,"```python
@frappe.whitelist()
def log_visit():
    if frappe.flags.read_only:
        return

    doc = frappe.new_doc(""Doc Visit"")
    doc.insert()
```

In this example, the `log_visit` function is a server-side function that logs page visits. Using `frappe.flags.read_only`, we check if the site is in read-only mode. If it is, the function returns without logging the visit. This ensures that database write operations are prevented during the upgrade, maintaining the read-only state of the site."
You are a Frappe Framework expert.,What about client-side changes? How can I use the `read_only_mode` key in Jinja for my website pages?,"```html
<!-- some html page -->
{% if read_only_mode %}
    <div class=""alert"">Site is running in read-only mode. Full functionality will be restored soon.</div>
{% endif %}
<!-- other content -->
```

This Jinja snippet checks for the `read_only_mode` key in the website context. If it's true, a warning message is displayed indicating that the site is in read-only mode. This way, users are informed that certain actions might not be available during the upgrade process."
You are a Frappe Framework expert.,Where can I find more information about Zero* Downtime Migrations in the Frappe documentation?,"You can find detailed information about Zero* Downtime Migrations on the Frappe Framework documentation page: [https://frappeframework.com/docs/user/en/zero*_downtime_migrations](https://frappeframework.com/docs/user/en/zero*_downtime_migrations). This page provides in-depth explanations, code examples, and further guidance on implementing this feature effectively."
You are an expert on the Frappe framework.,Can you explain how rate limiting works in Frappe?,"Frappe implements fixed window rate limiting based on the time consumed by requests. This means that the total time spent processing HTTP requests within a specified window is monitored. If the total time exceeds the configured limit, subsequent requests will be blocked and receive a 429 (Too Many Requests) response."
You are an expert on the Frappe framework.,How do I enable rate limiting in my Frappe site?,"You can enable rate limiting by adding a configuration section to your `site_config.json` file. Here's an example:

```json
{
  ""rate_limit"": {
    ""limit"": 600,
    ""window"": 3600
  }
}
```

This configuration sets the maximum permitted time within the rate limit window to 600 seconds and the window size to 3600 seconds."
You are an expert on the Frappe framework.,What do the different headers returned in the HTTP response tell me about rate limiting?,"The following headers provide information about the current rate limit status:

* **X-RateLimit-Limit:** The maximum time allowed within the rate limit window (in microseconds).
* **X-RateLimit-Remaining:** The remaining time (to be used) within the current rate limit window (in microseconds).
* **X-RateLimit-Reset:** The time remaining until the current rate limit window resets (in seconds).
* **X-RateLimit-Used:** The time used for processing the current request (in microseconds).
* **Retry-After:** This header is only returned for requests that exceed the limit. It specifies the time (in seconds) remaining until the current rate limit window resets."
You are an expert on the Frappe framework.,Where can I find more information about rate limiting in Frappe?,"You can find comprehensive information about rate limiting in the official Frappe documentation, specifically in the section on [Rate Limiting](https://frappeframework.com/docs/user/en/rate-limiting). This documentation explains the concept, configuration options, and how to interpret the returned headers."
You are a Frappe Framework expert.,Can you tell me about the basic rules for writing automated tests in Frappe?,"Sure, here are the basic rules for writing automated tests in Frappe:

1. **Test File Naming:** Test files must begin with `test_` and should be a `.py` file. They can be placed anywhere in your repository.
2. **Dependent DocTypes:** The test runner automatically builds test records for dependent DocTypes. These are identified by fields with the `Link` type (Foreign Keys).
3. **Non-DocType Tests:** For tests that don't involve DocTypes, you can write simple unit tests and prefix your file names with `test_`."
You are a Frappe Framework expert.,How do I write tests for DocTypes in Frappe?,"When you create a new DocType in developer mode, a boilerplate file named `test_{doctype}.py` is generated. This file should contain tests for your DocType, including creating dependencies and cleaning them up. You can refer to the `test_event.py` file as an example. This file demonstrates creating test events and then writing test cases to check permissions for different user types."
You are a Frappe Framework expert.,How can I write tests for Bench commands?,"To test your Bench commands, create a class that extends both `BaseTestCommands` (from `frappe.tests.test_commands`) and `unittest.TestCase`. This allows your tests to run during the `bench run-tests` command. You can find an example of this in the `TestCommands` class, which includes tests for the `bench execute` command."
You are a Frappe Framework expert.,How do I run my Frappe tests?,"Before running your tests, ensure all apps have development dependencies installed by running `bench setup requirements --dev`. You can then run tests from the `frappe_bench` folder using the following commands:

* `bench --site [sitename] run-tests`: Runs all tests.
* `bench --site [sitename] run-tests --app frappe`: Runs tests for the Frappe app only.
* `bench --site [sitename] run-tests --doctype ""Task""`: Runs tests for the Task DocType.
* `bench --site [sitename] run-tests --module frappe.tests.test_api`: Runs tests for a specific module.
* `bench --site [sitename] run-tests --module frappe.tests.test_api --test test_insert_many`: Runs a specific test from a test file.
* `bench --site [sitename] run-tests --skip-test-records --doctype ""Task""`: Runs tests without creating test records.
* `bench --site [sitename] run-tests --profile --doctype ""Task""`: Profiles tests and displays a report after execution.
* `bench --site [sitename] --verbose run-tests`: Runs tests with verbose logging."
You are a Frappe Framework expert.,How can I run my tests in parallel across multiple CI instances?,"You can run tests in parallel using the `run-parallel-tests` command. This allows you to split your tests across multiple CI instances for faster execution.

* **Command:** `bench --site [sitename] --app [app-name] run-parallel-tests --build-id <build-number> --total-build <total-number-of-builds>`
* **Usage:**  If you have 2 CI instances, run the command with `--build-id 1 --total-builds 2` on the first instance and `--build-id 2 --total-builds 2` on the second instance. This splits the tests into halves, running one half on each instance.

You can also use the [test orchestrator](https://github.com/frappe/test-orchestrator) for more balanced parallel testing. The orchestrator dynamically assigns tests to available CI instances, taking into account the execution time of each test.

* **Command:** `bench --site [sitename] --app [app-name] run-parallel-tests --use-orchestrator`
* **Usage:**  Run this command on each CI instance. Ensure that the environment variables `CI_BUILD_ID` and `ORCHESTRATOR_URL` are set.  `CI_BUILD_ID` is the unique ID of the CI build, and `ORCHESTRATOR_URL` is the publicly accessible URL of the orchestrator."

You are an expert on UI testing within the Frappe framework.,How can I generate code coverage reports for my Cypress tests?,"To generate code coverage reports, you need to instrument your source code using Istanbul and use the Cypress code-coverage plugin to collect and merge coverage results. Here's a breakdown of the steps:

1. **Instrument source code:** Use `npx nyc instrument` to replace your source code with instrumented code. For example, `npx nyc instrument -x 'frappe/public/dist/**' -x 'frappe/public/js/lib/**' -x '**/*.bundle.js' --compact=false --in-place frappe`.

2. **Run Cypress tests with coverage:** Execute `bench --site test_site run-ui-tests frappe --with-coverage` to run your tests and collect coverage data.

3. **Generate the report:** Use `npx nyc report --reporter=text` to generate a text-based report. You can also explore alternative report formats using the `nyc report` command."
You are an expert on UI testing within the Frappe framework.,What are Testing Library queries and how do they benefit UI testing?,"Testing Library queries provide a powerful way to find elements in your UI tests without relying on implementation details. These queries are designed to mimic how users interact with your application. Here are some key benefits:

* **User-centric testing:** Testing Library encourages you to write tests that reflect how real users would use your app.

* **Maintainability:** Tests become less brittle to changes in your codebase, as they focus on behavior rather than specific DOM structures.

* **Improved readability:** The queries are descriptive and easy to understand, making your tests more maintainable and understandable.

You can explore various Testing Library queries like `findByRole`, `findByLabelText`, `findByPlaceholderText`, `findByText`, `findByDisplayValue`, `findByTitle`, `findByAltText`, and `ByTestId` for specific element identification."
You are an expert on UI testing within the Frappe framework.,Can you provide an example of how to use a Testing Library query in a Cypress test?,"```javascript
// Find a button with the accessible name 'Save'
cy.findByRole('button', { name: 'Save' }).click();

// Find an input field with the placeholder 'Email'
cy.findByPlaceholderText('Email').type('test@example.com');
```

These examples demonstrate how to use `findByRole` and `findByPlaceholderText` queries to find specific elements and interact with them within your Cypress tests."
You are an expert on UI testing within the Frappe framework.,Where can I learn more about Testing Library queries?,"You can find comprehensive documentation on Testing Library queries at [https://testing-library.com/docs/queries/about](https://testing-library.com/docs/queries/about).

Using the quick select feature, you can efficiently select the desired customers in the list view and then use the relevant actions to send the email."
You are a Frappe framework expert.,How can I see the logs during development?,"When you run the `bench start` command, the log from each process defined in the `Procfile` is displayed in the terminal window. You can find the logs for each process, such as `web`, `worker_short`, or `redis_cache`, within the terminal output."
You are a Frappe framework expert.,Where are the logs stored?,"By default, logs are stored in the `./logs` folder within your bench directory. From Frappe Version 13 onwards, logs are also available at the site level, located in `./sites/{site}/logs`."
You are a Frappe framework expert.,How can I debug my Python code?,"You can debug your Python code using print statements. Any `print` statements you add to your code will appear in the `web:` process log for request/response related code or in one of the `worker_` processes if the code runs in a background job. For a more interactive debugging experience, you can use VS Code and set breakpoints in your code. You can find more information about setting up VS Code debugging for Frappe Python [here](https://github.com/frappe/erpnext/wiki/VSCode-Debugging-for-Frappe-Python)."
You are a Frappe framework expert.,How do I debug client-side Javascript code?,"You can debug client-side Javascript code by adding a `debugger` statement within your JS file. Once you open your browser's DevTools, the code execution will pause at the `debugger` statement.  You can then use the DevTools console to inspect variables and step through your code."
You are a Frappe framework expert.,Can you explain how to use the browser console for client-side debugging?,"The browser console provides a powerful tool for client-side debugging. You can access the `frappe` object globally within the console to explore methods and properties, interact with the client API, and generally understand how your Javascript code functions. You can even use the console to run snippets of Javascript code to test out specific functionalities."
You are a Frappe framework expert.,I'm interested in using VS Code for debugging. Can you provide a step-by-step guide?,"Here's how to configure VS Code for debugging Frappe Python applications: 

1. **Update `Procfile`:** Comment out the line in the `Procfile` (located in your bench directory) that reads `web: bench serve --port 8000`. This modification ensures that the `web` process is run from VS Code instead of `bench start`.

2. **Get Visual Studio Code:** Install VS Code if you haven't already.

3. **Install the Python Extension:** Install the [Python Extension for VS Code](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-python.python) to provide Python language support and debugging capabilities.

4. **Update `launch.json`:** Add a new configuration to your `launch.json` file in VS Code. This configuration will mimic the functionality of the commented line in your `Procfile`. A typical configuration would look like this:

```json
{
  ""name"": ""Bench"",
  ""type"": ""python"",
  ""request"": ""launch"",
  ""program"": ""${workspaceFolder}/frappe/frappe/utils/bench_helper.py"",
  ""args"": [
    ""frappe"",
    ""serve"",
    ""--port"",
    ""8000"",
    ""--noreload"",
    ""--nothreading""
  ],
  ""pythonPath"": ""${workspaceFolder}/../env/bin/python"",
  ""cwd"": ""${workspaceFolder}/../sites"",
  ""env"": {
    ""DEV_SERVER"": ""1""
  }
}
```

* Note: This configuration assumes your workspace directory is the `apps` directory. Adjust the paths for `workspaceFolder`, `pythonPath`, and `cwd` if your workspace directory is different.

5. **Execute `bench start`:** Keep `bench start` running as usual.

6. **Start Debugging:** In VS Code, go to the Debug Panel (鈱樷嚙D) and click ""Start Debugging"" or use the keyboard shortcut (鈱樷嚙F5). This will launch your web application under the debugger, allowing you to set breakpoints and step through your code.

**Caveats:**

* The debugger disables the auto-reload feature in Werkzeug. You can manually reload the page (鈱樷嚙F5) to achieve the same effect.
* Multithreading in Werkzeug is also disabled. This is because the VS Code debugger, similar to Django and Flask debuggers, doesn't work well with these features."
You are a Frappe framework expert.,What is the purpose of the `DEV_SERVER` environment variable?,"The `DEV_SERVER` environment variable is set to `1` by `bench start`. It's crucial for Socket.io to function correctly during development. If you're running `bench serve` directly without `bench start`, you need to explicitly set this environment variable in your VS Code configuration."
You are a Frappe framework expert.,"I'm a bit confused about the `program`, `args`, `cwd`, and `env` settings in the `launch.json` file. Can you elaborate on them?","Let's break down those settings in `launch.json`:

* **`program`:** Specifies the Python file that acts as the entry point for your application. In this case, it's `frappe/frappe/utils/bench_helper.py`, which handles the command-line interface for Frappe and is responsible for running the `serve` command.

* **`args`:** Defines the arguments passed to the Python program (`bench_helper.py`). In our configuration, it includes `frappe serve --port 8000 --noreload --nothreading`. This effectively replicates the behavior of `bench serve --port 8000 --noreload --nothreading` from the command line, ensuring your web application runs with the desired settings.

* **`cwd`:** Sets the current working directory for the Python program. We specify `${workspaceFolder}/../sites`, which indicates the `sites` directory should be used as the base directory for running the Frappe application.

* **`env`:** Allows you to define environment variables used during debugging.  In our configuration, `""DEV_SERVER"": ""1""` ensures that the `DEV_SERVER` variable is set to `1`, which is required for Socket.io to operate properly."
You are a Frappe framework expert.,Why does the VS Code debugger have problems with `use_reloader=True` and `threaded=True`?,"The VS Code debugger, as well as debuggers for Django and Flask, often encounter issues when working with `use_reloader=True` and `threaded=True`. These features introduce complexity in code execution, making it difficult for debuggers to consistently track and control the flow of execution. Disabling `use_reloader` and `threaded` in your application's settings allows for a smoother debugging experience by simplifying the code flow and enabling the debugger to accurately track the execution path."
You are a Frappe framework expert.,I understand that the debugger disables the auto-reload feature. How can I still benefit from code updates during debugging?,"While the debugger disables the automatic reloading provided by Werkzeug, you can still update your code and see the changes reflected in your application. Simply manually reload the page using the keyboard shortcut (鈱樷嚙F5) to apply the latest code modifications.  This allows you to update your code, manually reload the page, and continue debugging your application without the need for the automatic reload feature."

You are a Frappe Framework expert.,What is Frappe Recorder?,"Frappe Recorder is a built-in profiling tool designed to capture all requests and background jobs, along with the SQL queries executed and their corresponding stack traces. It's particularly useful for identifying performance bottlenecks within your applications."
You are a Frappe Framework expert.,How can I use Frappe Recorder to troubleshoot a slow DocType save?,"You can start Frappe Recorder, submit the document you believe is slow, and then review the captured data. This will show you all the queries executed during the save process, allowing you to identify any inefficient queries that might be causing the slowdown."
You are a Frappe Framework expert.,What kind of information does Frappe Recorder capture?,"Recorder captures a lot of useful information, including the requested path or job name, the method executed, the time of the request, its duration, the number of SQL queries, the time spent in those queries, HTTP request headers, form data, and a detailed breakdown of each SQL query with its duration, stack trace, and EXPLAIN output."
You are a Frappe Framework expert.,Is the duration captured by Frappe Recorder accurate?,"The overall duration might not be perfectly representative of real-world performance because Recorder introduces some overhead. However, the time spent in SQL queries is a very close approximation of real-world performance."
You are a Frappe Framework expert.,Can I use Frappe Recorder to profile Python code?,"Yes, Frappe Recorder can also run the built-in Python profiler 'cProfile' to give you detailed profiling information about running Python functions. You can enable this option when starting the recorder."
You are a Frappe Framework expert.,What is the 'bench' command in Frappe?,"'bench' is a powerful command-line tool used to manage Frappe applications. It allows you to execute various commands, including profiling, on your Frappe site."
You are a Frappe Framework expert.,How can I use the 'bench' command to profile a specific function?,"You can use the `bench execute` command with the `--profile` flag to profile a specific method by its dotted path. For example, to profile the `set_tasks_as_overdue` function in the `erpnext.projects.doctype.task.task` module, you'd use: `bench --site [sitename] --profile execute erpnext.projects.doctype.task.task.set_tasks_as_overdue`."
You are a Frappe Framework expert.,What is Frappe Monitor and how do I enable it?,"Frappe Monitor logs request and job metadata, providing valuable insights into your system's behavior. To enable it, you need to set the `""monitor"": 1` configuration in your site config file."
You are a Frappe Framework expert.,What kind of data does Frappe Monitor collect?,"Frappe Monitor collects information about requests, including their IP, method, path, response length, and status code. It also captures data about background jobs, such as their method, scheduling status, and wait time."
You are a Frappe Framework expert.,How can I monitor background jobs in Frappe?,Frappe uses RQ (Redis Queue) for background tasks. You can monitor them through two built-in virtual doctypes: RQ Worker and RQ Job.
You are a Frappe Framework expert.,What information does the 'RQ Worker' doctype show?,"The RQ Worker doctype displays all background workers consuming jobs from the queue on your site. It also provides basic statistics such as the worker's name, timing, job counts (successful and failed), and current status."
You are a Frappe Framework expert.,What can I do with the 'RQ Job' doctype?,The RQ Job doctype provides details about all background jobs. You can filter them by queue and status. Each job's form view gives you comprehensive information about the job itself.
You are a Frappe Framework expert.,What should I do if I suspect a worker process is stuck?,"You can send a `SIGUSR1` signal to the potentially stuck process. This will cause it to print the current stack of all its threads to `stderr`. You can usually find this output in the relevant log files: `bench/logs/web.error.log` for web workers, `bench/logs/worker.error.log` for background workers, and `bench/logs/schedule.error.log` for the scheduler."
You are a Frappe Framework expert.,How can I quickly check the general health of my Frappe services?,"The 'System Health Report' provides a comprehensive overview of your system's health, covering areas like background jobs, scheduler, database, cache, emails, error logs, storage, backups, and users. You can access it by searching 'System Health Report' in the Awesomebar."
You are a Frappe Framework expert.,How does the translation system in Frappe work?,"Frappe has a built-in translation system that extracts translatable strings from code and stores them in CSV files for different languages. The process involves three steps: 

1. **Extracting Translatable Strings:**  The system automatically identifies strings like field labels and descriptions from DocTypes and also extracts strings explicitly marked in code using `_()` or `__()` methods. 
2. **Translating Extracted Strings:**  These extracted strings are placed into language-specific CSV files. Translations are primarily contributed by Frappe and ERPNext users through the [translator portal](https://translate.erpnext.com). A bot verifies these submissions and merges them into the core code through pull requests weekly. 
3. **Translating Strings in App:**  Translations are essentially key-value pairs, mapping original strings to their translated equivalents. This dictionary is consulted when a string is written with `__('string')` in the code. If a translation exists, it's used instead of the original string."
You are a Frappe Framework expert.,I want to add a new language to my Frappe application. What steps do I need to follow?,"To add a new language to your Frappe application, follow these steps:

1. **Export to a file:** Use the command `$ bench --site sitename get-untranslated [lang] [path-to-file]` to export untranslated strings for the chosen language to a file.
2. **Translate:**  Create a new file with the translations for the exported strings, maintaining the same order. You can use tools like Google Translate or Bing Translator for assistance. 
3. **Import your translations:** Use the command `$ bench update-translations [lang] [source-path] [translated-path]` to import the translations into your Frappe application.
4. **Update `languages.json`:** Add your new language to the `frappe/geo/languages.json` file.
5. **Commit each app and push:** Commit the changes made to the `.csv` files in each app and push them to their respective repositories."
You are a Frappe Framework expert.,I'm writing a string with a variable in it. How should I format it for translation?,"When you have variables in a translatable string, you need to use the positional formatter `{0}`. Other formatter types are not supported. Here's an example in Python: 

```python
_('Welcome {0}, get started with ERPNext in just a few clicks.').format(full_name)
```

The same concept applies to JavaScript: 

```javascript
__('Welcome {0}, get started with ERPNext in just a few clicks.', [full_name])
```

This ensures that the variable is correctly replaced with its value during translation."
You are a Frappe Framework expert.,What are some common mistakes to avoid when writing translatable strings in Frappe?,"Here are some common mistakes to avoid when writing translatable strings in Frappe:

1. **Using variables or expressions instead of literal strings:** The string to be translated should always be a literal string.  
2. **Using formatters other than `{0}` for variables:** Use only the positional formatter `{0}` when including variables in your strings.  
3. **Splitting strings into separate blocks or using multiline strings:** Always write the entire string in a single line, even if it's long. 
4. **Trying to pluralize words using logic:** Don't assume that plural forms are consistent across languages. Use separate strings for singular and plural forms.  
5. **Starting or ending sentences with spaces:** Trailing spaces can be trimmed by the translation engine, affecting the output in other languages. 
6. **Not using the `context` variable to add context for a string:** When a string has multiple meanings, use the `context` variable to specify the intended context. This allows for accurate translation based on the specific meaning. "
You are a Frappe framework expert.,Can you explain what logging is and why it's important in Frappe?,"Logging in Frappe is a powerful tool for debugging and understanding how your application is performing. It allows you to track events, errors, and other important information, which helps you identify and fix issues, analyze application behavior, and improve overall system performance. Logging provides a detailed record of events, which is crucial for troubleshooting and debugging, especially in complex applications like those built with Frappe."
You are a Frappe framework expert.,I'm interested in learning more about Desk Logs. Can you tell me how they are accessed and what kind of information they provide?,"Desk Logs are accessible directly from the Frappe Desk UI. You can usually search for them using the Awesomebar feature, which is a quick search bar in the Frappe Desk. Desk Logs primarily track operational events, providing insight into how the Frappe application is working.  You can use their APIs to track information from your custom Frappe apps, creating a more tailored logging experience for your specific needs."
You are a Frappe framework expert.,I'm working with Server Logs. Could you explain where I can find them in the bench folder and what some of the key log files are?,"Server Logs are found in your bench folder, usually located in the `./logs` and `./sites/{site}/logs` directories.  Some of the most helpful files at the bench level include: 

* `bench.log`: Tracks bench commands executed, providing insights into your bench operations. 
* `scheduler.log`: Provides information about scheduled jobs and their execution status. 
* `worker.log`: Contains logs related to background jobs and worker processes."
You are a Frappe framework expert.,I noticed the mention of error snapshots. What are they and how do they help with debugging?,"Error snapshots are Frappe's way of capturing detailed information about server errors, specifically HTTP response codes from 500 and above. When a server error occurs, a snapshot is created that includes a traceback of the error, the state of the application, and other relevant context.  These snapshots are stored in a JSON file within the `./sites/{site}/error-snapshots` directory. They are synchronized with the site's database and can be accessed through the Frappe Desk as records in the Error Snapshot DocType.  By examining the error snapshots, you can gain a much deeper understanding of what caused the error and make it easier to pinpoint the root cause of the problem."
You are a Frappe framework expert.,What is the purpose of the Log Settings doctype?,"The Log Settings doctype provides a central place to configure the retention period for your logging doctypes. By default, many logging doctypes have a set retention period, which means old log entries are automatically removed after a certain amount of time. The Log Settings doctype allows you to customize this retention period based on your needs, ensuring that you retain important log information for as long as you require it while also managing the size of your log files."
You are a Frappe framework expert.,I'm interested in learning more about how to use the Frappe Logging API. Could you provide some guidance?,"The Frappe Logging API offers a powerful way to interact with Frappe's logging system programmatically. You can find detailed documentation on the Frappe Logging API at [https://frappeframework.com/docs/user/en/api/logging](https://frappeframework.com/docs/user/en/api/logging). It provides a way to log messages, errors, and other events directly from your Frappe applications.  By leveraging the API, you can create custom logging behaviors that are tailored to your application's specific needs and provide you with even more control over the information that is captured in your Frappe logs."
